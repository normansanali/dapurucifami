As usual, comedic hijinks led to a variety of misunderstandings, which created an awkward situation when Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) met Joshua's parents for the first time in a minimum of clothing. Somewhat surprisingly, the two Perrys did not actually share any scenes.</p><p>However, the father-son duo appeared in a variety of other productions together. They first shared the small screen in a 1979 episode of "240-Robert," a series about a special task force within the Los&nbsp;Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The elder Perry led the series as&nbsp;Deputy Theodore Roosevelt "Trap" Applegate III. The younger Perry made his television debut at age 9 as a character named Arthur. In the episode, titled "Bank Job," Trapp's team is forced to combat a team of bank robbers, during which Trapp meets a number of young civilians, including Arthur, who are caught in the mix. They next joined forces in 1993 on the third episode of "Home Free," a short-lived sitcom centered on Matt Bailey, a character portrayed by a 23-year-old Matthew. In the episode, Bailey, a young and overly self-confident journalist, confronts a judge (John Bennett Perry), who he believes is corrupt. In 1997, they also both appeared in "Fools Rush In,"&nbsp;a romantic comedy starring Matthew and Salma Hayek.&nbsp;</p><p>Seven years later, the two were back on the small screen again, appearing in a single episode of "Scrubs" together. Their final shared TV appearance came courtesy of the final episode of Matthew's short-lived 2011 sitcom, "Mr. Sunshine."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxjZ4Z2fY6wn5qsXayybrfNqK5mpZGpwamx1mannqqirnqnrcyorKxllpbBqbHRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
