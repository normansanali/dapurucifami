The Kardashians have been baring their souls for fans on television since 2007, but <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a> has always preferred to keep a low profile — especially when it comes to her love life.</p><p>Although she’s been linked to several famous men through the years, Jenner doesn’t talk much about relationships. The model was most recently linked to <a href=#><strong>Devin Booker</strong></a>, with whom she went Instagram official in February 2021.</p><p>A source told Us Weekly the couple made their relationship public because “<a href=#>they were tired of the media frenzy</a> and were ready to confirm their romance.”</p><p>The duo had been a couple for about 10 months when they went public on Valentine’s Day. According to an insider, they “just felt like with [the holiday] the timing was right.”</p><p>Rumors started swirling about them in April 2020 after <a href=#>they took a trip to Sedona, Arizona</a>, together.

While the public has watched as her parents <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Caitlyn Jenner</strong></a>‘s marriage, along with the relationships of sister <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a>, come and go, Kendall has said she would rather keep things low-key until she and her beau are certain.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She said in a 2019 interview with <a href=#>Vogue Australia</a> that going public with certain relationships tends to make things “so much messier” in the end.
