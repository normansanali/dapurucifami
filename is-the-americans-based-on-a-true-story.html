Set in the early 1980s, the series stars <a href=#>Matthew Rhys</a> and <a href=#>Keri Russell</a> as Elizabeth and Phillip Jennings — KGB agents from Russia working deep undercover in Washington, D.C. as a seemingly normal, suburban couple.</p><p>2023 marked ten years since the series made its television debut, and boy, do we feel old.</p><p>Looking back on the critically acclaimed series, many fans wonder — is The Americans based on a true story?

Yes and no …</h2><p>You can’t believe everything that you see on TV, but when it comes to FX’s The Americans, art certainly imitates life. Although The Americans isn’t totally based on a true story, it is inspired by one.</p><p>History buffs might notice that Elizabeth and Philip’s story sounds eerily similar to that of Tracey Lee Ann Foley and Donald Howard Heathfield (born <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elena Vavilova and Andrey Bezrukov</a>), Russian spies who were arrested along with eight other sleeper agents by the FBI in 2010.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Elena Vavilova and Andrey Bezrukov?

The couple was ultimately deported to Europe as part of a prisoner exchange agreement between the U.S. and Russia.</p><p>Much like Elizabeth and Philip, Tracey and Donald shared two children. But instead of a daughter and son named Henry (Keidrich Sellati) and Paige (Holly Taylor), Tracey and Donald had sons: Canadian-born Alexander and Timothy Vavilov.</p><p>In 2017, federal courts ruled that the brothers were not guilty of their parents’ crimes and in turn, granted Canadian citizenship.</p><p>At a press conference, Alexander shared that both he and his parents were fans of the FX adaptation of their lives. "My parents said they enjoyed watching it because it at least portrayed the sense of patriotism and the sense of connection. It’s a good show,” he shared (per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>.)</p><p>You can stream all six seasons of The Americans now on Hulu!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuwMeeZJqllae2pK3NrGSbmaOasW67zWaYZqyiqrJuv9OoqbI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
