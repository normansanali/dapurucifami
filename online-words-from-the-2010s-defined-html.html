The why is surprisingly simple: “Humans interact with each other and they’re social and when they find something funny, they repeat it,” says <a href=#>Gretchen McCulloch</a>, internet linguist and author of Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language. But since internet words are often so new, their origins are hard to pin down. Some, like “milkshake duck,” come from <a href=#>very specific tweets</a>. Others are brought over from the real world. “You get a lot of words that are appropriated from African-American English, which is not a phenomenon that’s specific to the internet,” McCulloch explains. And, like most things we have to be thankful for, the teens and ever-inventive stans are often responsible for making them cool. (Thinking fondly of “Ok boomer.”) “Words related to internet phenomenon have been shifting over the past couple decades or so from being associated with the technical implementation aspects of the internet to being associated with internet as a cultural space,” says McCulloch, adding that internet culture and youth culture go hand in hand now. As the stans’ online reign continues, who knows what the 2020s will bring? Here are some of the phrases we couldn’t stop saying this decade and that our grandchildren will undoubtedly make fun of us for in the next few.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ck3holo81004c3a67hsm4w297@published data-word-count=36><strong>@Me</strong>: Literally, it means to include someone’s Twitter @ (“at”) name in a tweet, but it’s often used to say someone should speak to you directly.
