The <a href=#>Girl With the Dragon Tattoo actress</a>, 37, and the Joker star, 47, share son River, <a href=#>who they welcomed in fall of 2020</a>.</p><p>Kate and Bell’s hangouts with Rooney and Phoenix go well beyond their “<a href=#>family connection</a>,” per the insider. The foursome “have a ton of interests in common,” including their “commitment to animal rights reform,” the source adds.</p><p>The <a href=#>House of Cards alum</a> previously spoke about balancing her work life and role as a mother, <a href=#>telling Emmy magazine</a> in October 2020, “I find it quite easy to switch it on and off, thank God.”</p><p>Kate explained that it has been a blessing to bring her daughter to set and keep up her career. “As a new mom when you have a baby on your boob screaming in the trailer, and then you’ve got to go pretend to be sexy, it’s kind of a complete nightmare,” she said, adding that her choice in roles has shifted since welcoming her baby girl.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Eventually she’s going to be able to look at the work I’ve done,” <a href=#>the American Horror Story alum</a> explained. “And now more than ever, I want it to mean something and for there to be a point to it. Sometimes you do just have to work for money. Sometimes you’re lucky enough that you can make choices based on more than that.”</p><p>Watch the exclusive video above to learn more about Kate and Bell’s relationship — and pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly on newsstands now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaipqOesaZ5ypqrnmWdlr%2BiecCnm2aikaK2pnnBnqOlq12lv6rCwK2cZqqfoq6vr8RmmZqaqWK9ra3NrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
