Nevertheless, it created an uncomfortable working dynamic in the company.</p><p>Matthew would complain to his partner Mike about several other “issues” he minds about like the “inappropriate font” in presentation and workstation standards.</p><p>Matthew’s signature on the document revealed that he gets his own copy of non-public Abercrombie & Fitch statistics, such as shop sales figures and daily revenue statements. In the manual, there were also instructions on how to ‘serve’ Matthew aboard the company jet. After 2 p.m., Darjeeling tea must be “served on a small tray with a small tray liner,” according to his tea service notes.</p><p>A private family office that oversees Jeffries’ homes, investments, and compensation, into something more substantial. According to insiders, David Leino, A&F’s senior vice president of real estate, has joked with coworkers that he works for Smith and has spoken freely about having to rush off to his “Matthew meetings.”</p><p>A former pilot of the company jet filed the lawsuit in October, claiming he was dismissed for being ‘too old.’ He charged that Matthew helped screen new employees for the jet, and acted on behalf of Abercrombie & Fitch.</p><h3><strong>Are Mike Jeffries And His Partner Matthew Smith Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Reports suggest that yes, Mike Jeffires and his partner Matthew Smith are still together.
