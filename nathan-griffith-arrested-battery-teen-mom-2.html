Nathan, 35, was taken into custody after Las Vegas police received a call around 9:15 p.m. on Wednesday night from a home at which Nathan was residing, according to TMZ, which cited “law enforcement sources”. He was handcuffed and escorted out of the home after police concluded he committed battery against a family member. His bail was set at $5,000 as of July 13, per<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Entertainment Weekly</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nathan-griffith-arrested-splashnews-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>This isn’t Nathan’s first run-in with the law. The former MTV star was charged with committing domestic battery by strangulation against a woman in February of this year, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. He was taken into custody after admitting to a family member that he “lost it” on a woman, choked her, and dragged her up the stairs, according to the outlet. The family member then called the police. The battery charges were dropped in March, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The U.S. Sun</a>.</p><p class=p1></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Nathan married <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>May Oyola</a></strong> in 2022, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. The Feb. 2023 incident did not involve her, but another woman, according to The Sun. It is not known who Nathan’s latest physical assault involved at the time of this writing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nathan-griffith-arrested-splashnews-embed11.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Nathan is the father of&nbsp; Jenelle Evans’ 9-year-old son, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kaiser</strong></a>. The pair appeared on Teen Mom 2 together but were almost always fighting. They were engaged at one point but <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called off the wedding</a> in 2015 just a few months after getting engaged. “Nathan knows I took it [engagement ring] off,” Jenelle told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY ahead of their official breakup. “We’re not going to put a front on like everything is okay. People go through ups and downs.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Nathan is not Jenelle’s first baby daddy to have run-ins with the law. Her husband, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>David Eason</strong></a>, was arrested in 2021 for<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> driving with a revoked license</a>, and in 2020, he was arrested on <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>charges of assault</a> with a deadly weapon and threatening Jenelle and two of her pals. He also made headlines in 2019 for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shooting the family dog</a> after it allegedly bit their daughter on the face. The scandal caused Jenelle and David to<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> temporarily lose custody of Kaiser</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BsZqeZpJ2ur3nGq6CfnpmptW6t0aucrKyVmXqjrdOtnKuxXamyprqMpqamZWJk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
