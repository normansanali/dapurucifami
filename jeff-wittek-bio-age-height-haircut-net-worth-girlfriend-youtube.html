Moreover, with his dark brown eyes and short dark brown hair, Jeff looks even more dashing and charismatic.</p><h2>Jeff Wittek: Haircut and Merch</h2><p>Jeff is famous in the entertainment world as the celebrity hairstylist known for his skills. So, how did he gain such fandom? It all started when he first created a Tumblr blog under the name ‘BehindTheCuts.’&nbsp;</p><p>After that, Wittek created a Vine account and started posting entertaining videos under the alias <strong>‘American Jeff.’ </strong>Furthermore, he got a chance to collaborate with many Vine artists, including <strong>Christian DelGrosso, Rudy Mancuso</strong>, and <strong>Anwar Jibawi.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>From Tumblr, Jeff then moved to YouTube and created a new account in 2011, where he started uploading acting sessions, hairstyle videos, and vlogs. From then to now, his YouTube followers have increased at a significant rate. At the moment, Wittek has over 2.27&nbsp;million subscribers, with more than 153 million views.</p><p>Some of his popular videos on his channel include ‘Homeless Man Makeover,” Giving David Dobrik a new haircut,’ Jonah Hill haircut ft. David Dobrik’ and many others. Moreover, each of those videos has amassed more than 3 million views already.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Navid Negahban Bio- Movies, TV Shows, Age, Wife, Net Worth, IG >></a></h4><p>As of April 30, his ‘Giving David Dobrick a New Haircut’ is the most-watched video followed by ‘Homeless Man Makeover’ on his channel. Besides being a hairstylist, Jeff is also an actor by profession.

To add up, he also runs a YouTube channel from where he earns a decent amount of money.</p><p>Moreover, as online sources claim, an American celebrity hairstylist makes about <strong>$100,000</strong> per year. And considering Jeff’s popularity, it seems he makes around <strong>$500-$10,000</strong> from his Instagram post alone.</p><h2>Personal Life: Girlfriend and Dating</h2><p>Jeff is a handsome and charming man who is in his prime year. Just like other celebrities, he also has a loyal fanbase who watches his every move. And quite frankly, Jeff too was not much of a secret keeper when it came to his relationship. In fact, the social media star was very open about it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/jeff-0003.jpg><p>Likewise, Wittek was in a romantic relationship with an American actress, <strong>Cierra Ramirez</strong>. The two lovebirds quickly took a liking to each other and started dating. Though many fans were heartbroken about the news, at the same time, they also supported his relationship.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay McGraw Bio- Wife, Kids, Age, Height, Net Worth, Books, IG >></a></h4><p>Moreover, the young man is also open when it comes to his relationship. As a matter of fact, both of them are seen attending many events and venues together. It seems the duo has been together since January 31, 2015, after one faithful encounter at the club.</p><p>However, social celebrity status is not an easy feat to handle. It might look glamorous and fun but needs just as much dedication as other fields of work.</p><p>But the very same thing Jeff was passionate about came in between his relationship with Cierra. Jeff posted a video titled ‘a personal conversation with my new friend’ on Toddy Smith’s YouTube channel where he expressed;</p><h3>“…but now when you are like experiencing these things that used to be great and like make great memories, you’re getting pulled like, ‘Okay, we gotta shoot this here and do this thing with the logo and the branding and all right guys smile, be happy, like laughs, and like hold hands, now kiss.”</h3><p>He then continued,</p><h3>“People are directing you to kiss and you guys are both feeling it like,’ Okay, are we in a real relationship, or are we doing something that’s convenient for both of us…”</h3><p>Though Cierra was supportive about it and understood the work, their relationship just could not be saved anymore. Hence, both of them decided to quit it like an understanding of adults.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Instagram</a>–&nbsp; 3 million Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">YouTube</a>–&nbsp; 2.27&nbsp;million Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Twitter</a>–&nbsp; 295.7k Followers</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57yZ6dn2WnnsG1scpmmaKnXZa0pnnHnqCgoKRitaK10ZysrWWemsFuw86rq6Fll56%2FrbLRopynnF2uvLbA1JucaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
