Having fulfilled all of his prior commitments, Ospreay is expected to join AEW in the near future. AEW also has major plans for Ospreay and now they have been revealed.</p><p>Will Ospreay’s AEW <a href=#>contract offers him unique flexibility</a>. Ospreay mentioned that joining AEW aligns well with his current circumstances, and his deal with AEW includes the possibility of a return to NJPW in the future.</p><p>While speaking on&nbsp;<a href=#>Wrestling Observer Radio</a>, Dave Meltzer mentioned that Will Ospreay will be competing at the AEW Revolution pay-per-view next month. To that effect, Ospreay is expect to appear on the February 21st edition of AEW Dynamite to set up the match.</p><p>”Will Ospreay is scheduled to be wrestling at Revolution. Ospreay’s got no more dates following his RevPro match with Michael Oku so he would probably show up on next week’s Dynamite to do the angle for his match.”</p><p>Will Ospreay also had his final NJPW match for the time&nbsp;<a href=#>being at New Beginning in Osaka</a>. He will also have to navigate very <a href=#>demanding travel schedule while working in AEW</a>. It remains to be seen how his match at AEW Revolution will turn out, as fans are certainly excited about it.</p><p>What’s your opinion on this Will Ospreay story?
