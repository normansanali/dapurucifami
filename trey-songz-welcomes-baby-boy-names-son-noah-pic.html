The little one held his hands up by his face as he rested in a bear-patterned onesie. “My son Noah,” the “Slow Motion” singer wrote. “We are blessed and overjoyed. Peace.”</p><p>The Virginia native opened up about wanting to be a dad in 2015. “Man, I want kids,” he told <strong>Charlamagne&nbsp;Tha God</strong> on The Breakfast Club at the time. “I’ve been wanting children before you could even imagine. I raised all the kids in my family. My younger brother, he’s 20 years old, he just had his first child. I remember when he was a child. I used to burp him, change his diapers, now he got a baby.”</p><p>The BET Award winner added: “I’m not in a rush to do it because people think that’s what should be happening in my life or that I need kids or my momma been begging me for a grandbaby or any of that, I just want to make sure that it’s the right decision.”</p><p>When Charlamagne, 40, recommended he “just take the condom off,” Songz said, “I don’t think it’s that simple for me. … It’s more to it than that, I would like to believe.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Trey-Songz-welcome-baby-boy.jpg><p>After the R&B singer’s&nbsp;Instagram announcement, celebs took to social media to share their congratulations.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Finally&nbsp;HAHAAAAA YES!!!” <strong>Kehlani</strong> commented, while<a href=#> <strong>Kevin Hart</strong></a> added, “Congrats champ.” <a href=#><strong>Marlon Wayans</strong></a> told Songz, “It’s the greatest feeling ever.”</p><p>Songz&nbsp;was not romantically linked to anyone prior to his baby news.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGatqpWuerS7zaCxZq%2BVobCwucSsZJuZkq56o7vYZqWapZWoerS7zWalqJmYYr2qr44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
