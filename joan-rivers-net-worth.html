Best known as a television show host, Joan Rivers has earned widespread recognition for her irreverent humour – which, despite attracting its share of criticism, secured Rivers a Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host in 1990, as well as multiple nominations for other awards. Taking into account that Joan Rivers has also found considerable success as an author – having published no less than a dozen memoirs and humour books, many of which went on to be best-sellers – it is definitely not hard to see why Rivers’s net worth is as sizable as it is.</p><h3>Joan Rivers Net Worth $150 Million</h3><p>Born on 8 June 1933 in the New York City borough of Brooklyn in the US, Joan Rivers grew up to the hustle and bustle of the Big Apple. It was here that Rivers first picked up her trademark New Yorker accent, by which she is still recognizable to this day. Though her family moved out of New York later on, Joan Rivers would return in 1953 to attend the local Barnard College – and here that she would take her first steps into show business. Rivers’s first acting debut was in the late 1950s play “Driftwood”, where she appeared opposite the future American music legend, Barbra Streisand. Afterwards, Rivers continued to appear in various local theatre productions and comedy clubs, eventually attracting enough attention to land a guest role on the “NBC” talk show “The Tonight Show”.</p><p>“The Tonight Show” would turn out to be Joan Rivers’s ticket to fame. After a few appearances alongside legendary show host Jack Paar, Rivers was eventually invited back to the show as hosted by Johnny Carson. Rivers has been quoted crediting Carson with teaching her most of what she knows, going as far as referring to her time on “The Tonight Show” as a time when she was Johnny Carson’s daughter. Unfortunately, their long-standing friendship would come to an abrupt end when Joan Rivers landed a job with “Fox” that had her hosting “The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers” on the same timeslot as Carson’s “The Tonight Show”. While “The Late Show” would not bring Rivers much success, it did open the door for her to begin focusing on her own, independent projects, and these have been the mainstay of Rivers’s net worth throughout most of her career.</p><p>How rich is Joan Rivers? At the moment, Rivers’s net worth is believed to reach up to $150 million. Most of this considerable amount is owed to Joan Rivers’s long-standing success as a comedian, television host and writer. In addition to her time as the host of various popular television shows – including “The Joan Rivers Show” – Rivers has also found success as a writer, producing a number of best-selling autobiographical and humoristic books. Despite her advanced age, Joan Rivers continues to remain an active performer and host, and she currently hosts her own online talk show, “In Bed with Joan”.</p><p>Currently, Joan Rivers lives in Malibu, California, together with her daughter, Melissa Rivers.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Trademarks</li><li>Salary</li><li>Quotes</li><li>Facts</li><li>Pictures</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Joan Rivers</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$150 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 8, 1933, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, United States)</td></tr><tr><td>Died</td><td>September 4, 2014, New York City, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Brooklyn</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 2 in (1.575 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Comedian, Talk show host, Actor, Screenwriter, TV Personality, Writer, Voice Actor, Television producer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Connecticut College, Barnard College, Connecticut College, Barnard College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Edgar Rosenberg (m. 1965–1987), James Sanger (m. 1955–1955)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Melissa Rivers</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Meyer C.

For three years, my husband and I slept in bunk beds.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I have no sex appeal. If my husband didn’t toss and turn, we’d never have had any kids.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I wish I had a twin, so I could know what I’d look like without plastic surgery.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>All I ever heard when I was a kid was,”Why can’t you be more like your cousin Sheila?” And Sheila had died at birth.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>People say that money is not the key to happiness. But I’ve always figured that, with enough money, you can hire a battering ram.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>The great thing about irrigating your colon is that sometimes you find old jewelry.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>My love life is like a piece of Swiss cheese: much of it’s missing, and what’s there stinks.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>If you don’t want gays in the military, make the uniforms ugly.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>[on Renee Zellweger] Push her face against a glass door, and you’ll see what all babies look like at birth.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Want to know why women don’t blink during foreplay? Not enough time.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>[on Justin Bieber] He looks like the daughter Cher wishes she’d had.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>At my funeral, I want Meryl Streep crying in five different accents.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>[on daughter Melissa Rivers] She and I are very close. We speak every single day. Literally, I call her every day and leave the same message on her answering machine: “Pick the hell up, Melissa. I know you’re there, damn it.” And she always calls me back with the same response: “Mom, how in God’s name did you get this new number?”</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>A study says owning a dog makes you 10 years younger. I’d rescue two more, but who wants to go through menopause twice?</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>There are three things all children should be taught never to do: touch a hot stove; pull lamps off tables; and wake their mother before noon.</td></tr><tr><td>17</td><td>I hate housework. You make the beds, you do the dishes…and six months later, you have to start all over again.</td></tr><tr><td>18</td><td>Never be afraid to laugh at yourself; after all, you could be missing out on the joke of the century.</td></tr><tr><td>19</td><td>Look at Gwyneth Paltrow being named the Most Beautiful this year. Congratulations, Gwyneth! Now look at who she got to vote: Ray Charles, José Feliciano, Helen Keller, Ronnie Milsap, Tom Sullivan, and Stevie Wonder.</td></tr><tr><td>20</td><td>I haven’t missed the Emmys since that year my makeup team was nominated for “Best Special Effects”!</td></tr><tr><td>21</td><td>The secret of my success is just saying what everybody else has been thinking.</td></tr><tr><td>22</td><td>My best birth control now is just to leave the lights on.</td></tr><tr><td>23</td><td>[her trademark line] Can we talk?</td></tr><tr><td>24</td><td>[on the red-carpet] Who are you wearing?</td></tr><tr><td>25</td><td>I don’t exercise. If God had wanted me to bend over, he would have put diamonds on the floor.</td></tr><tr><td>26</td><td>[In 2010, on Twitter] With all the plastic surgery I’ve had, I’m worried that when I die, God won’t recognize me!</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>[on antiques] If Louis XIV hasn’t sat on it, I don’t want it.</td></tr><tr><td>28</td><td>That awful, vulgar, loud woman on stage, that’s not me. I wouldn’t want to be her friend.</td></tr><tr><td>29</td><td>Men who look down my dress usually compliment me on my shoes.</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>New York was the magic city. New York was Oz. All I wanted to do was get out of Brooklyn and get into Oz. We’d go to the theater district — I saved my money, and I would go with a girlfriend and sit in Sardi’s, order an avocado for 60 cents, and wait to be discovered. They must have been thrilled to see us. We went to Howard Johnson’s, and my friend smoked a cigarette. We’re sitting at the Howard Johnson’s, and we’re smoking cigarettes — say no more.</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>Boy George is all England needs. Another queen who can’t dress.</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>Having my daughter, I screamed for twenty-three hours straight. And that was just during conception.</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>[on reality shows] When was the last time you went to a dinner party where three women got up and slapped each other? Everybody’s punching and slapping. This is not reality. We got a second season because everybody that has a parent, a mother, anyone can relate to what really happens between adult children and parents.</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>[on the passing of Elaine Kaufman] Elaine’s was a place you went to let everyone know you were in town. It was first stop L.A./N.Y. You knew your name was above the title when Elaine sat with you. I also loved that the prices changed constantly.</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>[Interview with Andrew Scott, June 10, 2010] I’ve never been in the “in” group. I’ve never been considered. But that’s what keeps me punching, if that makes sense. I’m still in the “I’ll show you” mentality.</td></tr><tr><td>36</td><td>[In an interview, on the British chat show Loose Women (1999) in 2008, on working the red carpet for the E! Channel]: You get someone like Russell Crowe, and you want to say to the camera, he is a piece of – get ready to bleep this – f***ing shit. (Rivers was immediately pulled from the British chat show – they had no bleep.) These idiots came running onto the set, ripped me off my seat and dragged me off, saying, “Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.” When the audience saw my empty chair, I worried that, because of my age, they might think I’d wet it because my diaper leaked. People always ask me, “What haven’t you done, Miss Rivers? You’ve done this and that, been nominated for an Emmy and a Tony. You’ve hosted shows, you’ve acted, done stand-up, lost your husband to suicide, been bankrupted by a business partner [who made off with $37m in the 1990s] – what haven’t you done?”. Well, until today, I’d never been kicked off live television. Assholes.</td></tr><tr><td>37</td><td>I knew I was an unwanted baby when I saw my bath toys were a toaster and a radio.</td></tr><tr><td>38</td><td>My husband wanted to be cremated. I told him I’d scatter his ashes at [the department store] Neiman Marcus – that way, I’d visit him every day.</td></tr><tr><td>39</td><td>One of the earliest jokes I did about my husband was that I was the one who really caused Edgar’s suicide, because, while we were making love, I took the bag off my head.</td></tr><tr><td>40</td><td>There is not one female comic who was beautiful as a little girl. Tell me one funny woman who was ever beautiful. Gwyneth Paltrow, stop, please, stop, I can’t stand it. Angelina Jolie? Men don’t want you funny. It’s all about coping when you’re not being the pretty girl, and you’re not being the first one asked to dance, and the bottle spins and lands on you and Stuart Wein doesn’t want to kiss you.</td></tr><tr><td>41</td><td>I was just interviewed for a documentary [Making Trouble (2007)] on my least favorite subject – women comedians and how we’ve all been kept out. These two women came to my house, very serious, and asked, “How long did it take for you to get into the room?”. I said, “Let me tell you something: if Adolf Hitler had four good jokes, he’d be in the room.” It has to do with funny. Then they talked about how women help each other. I said, “I hate to tell you, but if it was between Sarah Silverman and me for a job? I’ll kill her and she’ll kill me. There’s no sisterhood in comedy”.</td></tr><tr><td>42</td><td>[June 29, 2008] One of the reasons I am so happy – there’s lots happening again. Four times in my life, I woke up and the diary was empty. That’s the worst feeling in the world. My Broadway show and my talk show were canceled on the same Friday. And I went that night to see Barbra Streisand, whom I’d started with, perform for 20,000 people at Madison Square Garden. That was a very bad night. Now I’m doing a pilot, I have two books coming, I have my play, I’m in a series that they’ve shot and they hope will be successful, I’m doing stand-up and I’ve got my jewelry company. At this age, to be wanted – you are fighting every single step of the way.</td></tr><tr><td>43</td><td>[on young female comics]: They all come up to me and say, “Without you, I couldn’t be here, the barriers you broke down.” I say, “Get the f*** away from me. I still could take every one of you with one hand behind my back. Outta here. Talk like that at my funeral, but not till then”.</td></tr><tr><td>44</td><td>There is not one female comic who was beautiful as a little girl.</td></tr><tr><td>45</td><td>The only thing that’s saving me is my age. Because I don’t care. I’ve been up, I’ve been down. I’ve been fired, I’ve been hired. I’ve been broke. What are you gonna to do me? Not like me? I don’t give a damn.</td></tr><tr><td>46</td><td>I’m in nobody’s circle, I’ve always been an outsider. I don’t have those wonderful dinners with Woody, I’ve never been asked by Jay. And it makes you sad, because I think it would be wonderful to sit and talk about things that very few people understand. But I’m very competitive, and I’m sure they feel that. I’m jealous of that little slut Paris Hilton. Why? I’m very competitive. And I think that’s what has kept me going. I’m not gracious.</td></tr><tr><td>47</td><td>I want them to know I don’t think I’m wonderful, or better than they are. Part of comedy is saying: “I am you and you are me, and we’re all feeling the same thing”.</td></tr><tr><td>48</td><td>[on Parkinson (1971), when entering] I am a dyke! And I’m DAMN proud of it!</td></tr><tr><td>49</td><td>Camilla Parker-Bowles is an earthy, funny woman. You can swear in front of her.</td></tr><tr><td>50</td><td>Once I was having lunch in a fancy restaurant with Lily Tomlin and Richard Pryor. We were all struggling comics together and the day we had lunch, any one of us could have picked up the check. That’s when I knew I’d made it.</td></tr><tr><td>51</td><td>If you’re not a wreck in this business, you’re not around.</td></tr><tr><td>52</td><td>[on her idea of a perfect childbirth experience] Knock me out with the first pain, and wake me up when the hairdresser arrives.</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>A big influence on Canadian comedian Katherine Ryan.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Served as an Honorary Director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Celebrated her 80th birthday on an episode of Fashion Police (2002) and on QVC, on June 8, 2013.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Had briefly attended Brooklyn Ethical Culture School in Brooklyn, New York.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Before she was a successful actress and comedienne, she was part of “Jim, Jake, and Joan”, a comedic musical trio, in 1964.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Was merciless with subjects of popular piety.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Best remembered by the public as the hostess of The Joan Rivers Show (1989), Fashion Police (2002) and Joan & Melissa: Joan Knows Best?
