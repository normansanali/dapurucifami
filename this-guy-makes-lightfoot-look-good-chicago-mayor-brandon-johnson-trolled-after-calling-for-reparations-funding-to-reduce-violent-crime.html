We added $80 million to our youth employment program, hiring 25,000 young people just this summer, a 20% increase from the previous year."</p><p>He further expanded on his plans to hire an additional 4,000 young people during the upcoming summer and the establishment of an office dedicated to re-entry for those returning to the community after incarceration.</p><p>“We have stood up an entire office dedicated to re-entry. So individuals who are returning to our communities who have been incarcerated because of failed policies will have a welcoming space for them," he explained.</p><p>Johnson argued that reparations were a crucial component of breaking the cycle of violence.</p><p>“I’ve added a half a million dollars for restoration and reparations to address, again, the cycle of violence, which looks like school closings, closing of mental health facilities, of which I’ve invested in now. We’re going to open up two mental health clinics that were closed from two previous administrations ago," he explained.</p><p>“And so, in order for us to build a better, stronger, safer Chicago, it requires investments,” he reiterated, “and that’s what this budget has done – a $16.77 billion budget without raising property taxes, and we’re just getting started in the city of Chicago.”</p><p>Responding to Harlow's question about the impact of disinvestment in his neighborhood, Johnson shared a personal perspective.</p><p>"My wife and I, we’re raising our three children on the West Side of Chicago. It’s a beautiful part of the city. We love it," he stated. "But it also has been the side of the city of Chicago that has experienced gross disinvestment, from school closings, from lack of transportation, from lack of investments; and so, I wake up every single day in one of the most toughest parts of the city,” he added.</p><h2 class=split>Social media backlash</h2><p>However, the mayor's comments faced intense scrutiny on social media, with critics voicing their skepticism about the effectiveness of his approach.</p><p>"This guy makes Lightfoot look good, and that’s saying a lot, we all know how bad she was," one posted on X (formerly Twitter).</p><p>"He has made Lori Lightfoot look like a genius," another wrote.</p><p>"The only people more stupid than he is, are the people who voted for this NUMNUT!" a comment read.</p><p>"Reparations are just another form of begging for money for people who don’t deserve it. It’s a rebrand of affirmative action. It’s wrong and couldn’t be more insulting to black people — and all Americans," someone else added.</p><p>"So basically he wants to reward criminals. Every day I think things cannot get any weirder... and they just do. Smdh," another chimed in.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>This guy makes Lightfoot look good, and that’s saying a lot, we all know how bad she was.</p>— PoliticalPuertoRican 🇵🇷 𝕏 🇺🇸 (@PRMemes_) <a href=#>December 30, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>He has made Lori Lightfoot look like a genius.</p>— Juanita Broaddrick (@atensnut) <a href=#>December 30, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>The only people more stupid than he is, are the people who voted for this NUMNUT!</p>— 🇺🇸 Pismo 🇺🇸 (@Pismo_B) <a href=#>December 30, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Reparations are just another form of begging for money for people who don’t deserve it.</p><p>It’s a rebrand of affirmative action.</p><p>It’s wrong and couldn’t be more insulting to black people — and all Americans.</p>— Paul A.

Similarly, California's Reparations Task Force proposed substantial compensation for Black Californians in acknowledgment of perceived historical injustices, the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Post</a> reported.</p><p>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
