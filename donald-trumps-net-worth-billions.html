There are plenty of things that he has said over the years that have sparked headlines, both in the traditional media and on social media, and whether they like him or not, no one can deny that he has managed to make a name for himself.</p><p>One thing he seems to be pretty clear about is his net worth. According to Forbes Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his net worth</a> is somewhere around the $2.5 billion mark. However, Trump doesn't accept this and has been claiming that his net worth is a different amount entirely.</p><h2 id=how-did-donald-trump-build-up-his-net-worth>How Did Donald Trump Build Up His Net Worth?</h2><p>As a businessman who grew up surrounded by other businessmen, it was inevitable that Trump would end up going into the world of business in one way or another. And now having a net worth in the billions, there would have to be numerous ways that he has managed to build this net worth up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/instar41754501.png><p>One of these ways was getting paid <a href=#>$1 million for a Pizza Hut commercial</a>, and he has also been on TV in other circumstances, being on The Apprentice for over a decade (<a href=#>earning $427 million</a> in the process) and having small roles in Home Alone 2 and The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.</p><p>Other ways he has been able to <a href=#>amass his fortune</a> are through public speaking, property development, having private business holdings, and also from a loan from his father that helped him build up his businesses.</p><h2 id=what-does-donald-trump-say-his-net-worth-is>What Does Donald Trump Say His Net Worth Is?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/your-paragraph-text-2023-08-01t124542-092.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's very difficult for anyone to hide what their real net worth is these days as they can claim it to be anything and someone could do a quick internet search and tell you that you've got it wrong. However, Trump has found a way around this.</p><p>Whilst he hasn't explicitly said what he believes his net worth to be, he does like to point out to people that there are a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">variety of factors to consider when it comes to calculating his net worth</a>. Not just calculating his net worth every year, or even every few months, but every day.</p><p>Trump has previously claimed that his net worth changes based on the state of the market (which is true for everyone), but he also maintains that it changes according to both his and other people's attitudes and feelings.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Donald Trump Might Have Regretted His Endorsement Of Eminem For President</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This claim was first made to lawyers back in 2007 when Trump was in the middle of a deposition case after it was claimed in a book that Trump was only worth somewhere between $150,000 and $250,000.</p><p>Trump then went into further detail with his claim that the value of his net worth depends on how he is feeling, saying that his feelings on where the world is and where the world is going can change on a daily basis and that this, in turn, changes his net worth on a daily basis.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Donald Trump Has Thrown Some Notorious Parties At Mar-A-Lago Despite The Fact That He Doesn't Drink</a></span></p><p>This isn't the first time he's said something like this, as all the way back in 1987, Trump appeared on The Late Show with David Letterman, where the interview seemed to mostly be about whether Trump actually knows his net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>David was very clear that he <a href=#>wanted Trump to spill the beans on his net worth</a>, but Trump was determined to keep tight-lipped on the situation. There were many times throughout the interview that Trump tried to deflect the conversation onto something else entirely, but David was determined not to let the conversation slide.</p><p>Throughout the interview, Trump kept on saying that he had absolutely no idea what his net worth was. But when David asked Trump if he was worth a billion dollars, Trump replied "perhaps" and refused to say anything else.</p><p>However, there have also previously been rumors that <a href=#>Trump could end up broke</a> one day, particularly as he was reported to be broke before and one year he even managed to <a href=#>lose $600 million</a> in that time, which took him all the way down to the 429th richest person in America.</p><h2 id=how-does-donald-trump-spend-his-net-worth>How Does Donald Trump Spend His Net Worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/donald-trump-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite having taken a massive hit to his net worth, Trump is still a billionaire, which means he should have plenty of wriggle room to spend that fortune on whatever he requires.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Donald Trump May Have Little To Do With Daughter Tiffany Trump But She's Living Life Much Larger Than Him</a></span></p><p>Some of the more luxurious <a href=#>items that Trump spends his money</a> on include golf, luxury cars, mansions, watches, private jets, properties to go on vacation to, the gold-coated Trump Tower penthouse, designer clothes, suits, and ties, a helicopter, and a private yacht.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqKaRobFuwNGupKmrXaOytXnWqKmtoF2Xtq24yKilrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
