Former <i>Matrix</i> directors <strong>Lana and Lilly Wachowski</strong> won’t be taking helm of the film this time around, with <i>The Martian</i> screenwriter <strong>Drew Goddard</strong> stepping in for directing and writing duties. Lana, who helmed the 2021 <i>Matrix</i> film <i>Resurrections</i>, is attached as an executive producer.</p><p class=p1>There’s no word yet on if stars from the <a href=#>previous installments</a> — including <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>, <strong>Carrie-Anne Moss</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Groff</strong> and <strong>Priyanka Chopra Jonas</strong> — will be returning to the underworld. The studio remains tight-lipped about the film’s plot, though Warner Bros. Motion Pictures president of production<strong> Jesse Ehrman</strong> teased in a statement that fans can expect a few changes to the universe.</p><p class=p1>“Drew came to Warner Bros. with a new idea that we all believe would be an incredible way to continue the Matrix world, by both honoring what Lana and Lilly began over 25 years ago and offering a unique perspective based on his own love of the series and characters,” Ehrman said. “The entire team at Warner Bros. Discovery is thrilled for Drew to be making this new <i>Matrix</i> film, adding his vision to the cinematic canon the Wachowskis’ spent a quarter of a century building here at the studio.”</p><p class=p1>Goddard, whose writing credits include <i>World War Z </i>and <i>Cloverfield</i>, shared his excitement about entering the <i>Matrix</i> world with his own statement, emphasizing that the films changed “both cinema and [his] life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Matrix-5-in-the-Works-2.jpg><p class=p1>He added, “Lana and Lilly’s exquisite artistry inspires me on a daily basis, and I am beyond grateful for the chance to tell stories in their world.”</p><p class=p1>Reeves, who played Neo in the past four films, hinted that he previously turned down “other agents” interested in making another <i>Matrix</i> film. While promoting <a href=# rel><i>Resurrections </i></a>in 2021, the actor explained that his interest level in returning to the franchise was “not really” there until he heard from Lana.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“But, for me, I had a hesitancy in being involved in something that wasn’t signed off by the Wachowskis,” he <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i>, noting that he was “grateful and thrilled” when Lana reached out about the film’s fourth installment, <i>The Matrix Resurrections.&nbsp;</i></p><p class=p1>The film, which arrived two decades after the original, hit home for Reeves with its message.</p><p class=p1>“It was all about the love story,” he said. “[Lana’s] desire to bring Neo and Trinity [Carrie-Anne Moss] together again, and the feeling that it could be good medicine for her, for the story, and, potentially, for the audience.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSarKKexW6BjJymp56Zp7qmsIxsZLKdkafAbq3FrZyrZaSdsm65wK2porBdp7K0wdGrnJysmaS7tHnRnqOemaOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
