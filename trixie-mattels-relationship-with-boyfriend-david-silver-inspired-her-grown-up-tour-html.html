That’s why adults go to drag shows... I guess I like a show where we can&nbsp;make the audience feel like kids, but also address their adulthood fears.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But more than that, the comic wanted material for her new tour to come from the three years she spent with Silver. This is definitely not the first time her romantic endeavors, or a lack there-of&nbsp;have&nbsp;been the source material for her shows. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>For instance, Ages 3 and Up featured a healthy segment about her break-up while the&nbsp;Moving Parts was drawn from a place of singlehood.&nbsp;However, the multi-faceted drag queen promised that the upcoming show was from a different world.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Silver ‘Hates’ Being Put In The Shows</h2><p>Mattel's relationship with Silver is the longest one she&nbsp;has ever been in, so&nbsp;it is understandable&nbsp;and expected&nbsp;that it has inspired her&nbsp;creative expressions. On his part though, Silver would rather not be put in the show.&nbsp;</p><p>Mattel <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">explained</a> how Silver&nbsp;detests it when she jokes on the intimate stuff onstage, especially with&nbsp;his mother in&nbsp;the audience.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>...and I’m like, ‘Does she think we are gay so we can share clothes?’</p><h2>‘Grown Up’ Was Supposed To Have A 2020&nbsp;Tour</h2><p>All that being said, Trixie had originally <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">planned</a> the Grown Up tour for 2020, but it had to be rescheduled. In an interview with PopMatters,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she confessed</a> that moving the dates and the overall lockdown scene made her sad.&nbsp;</p><p>But she refused to sit there and moan about it! Instead, Mattel&nbsp;decided to focus on the things she could get done from her condo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGijoJqknr5wwNGir6KdXaKutcDEpapmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYsSqwMdmmaixlqe2prrDZpuarpmZerS1y6%2Bcq2WZo8CxtdGem2aglad6qL7OsKVmraBiwbDB0WefraWc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
