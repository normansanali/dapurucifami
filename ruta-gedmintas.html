What are some of your favorite memories from being in the show?</p><p>Ruta: I am a big Beatles fan. Getting to hear those songs every night, sung so well by my talented friends was brilliant. To pretend to live in that world was a pretty mesmerizing experience as a fan of the band. Andy Knott embodied John Lennon so well.</p><p>Interviewer: You play the role of Dutch in the TV series The Strain. Can you give us an insight as to what it is like being a part of this popular production?</p><p>Ruta: It’s an incredibly fun and generous set, with a wonderful cast and crew who make every day creative and interesting. The sets are intricately detailed and on a huge scale, it’s a feast for an actors imagination. I feel very lucky to be part of it.</p><p>Interviewer: Aired earlier this year (2016), you play the role of Sophie in Stag – a British black comedy television serial. Can you tell us about Stag?</p><p>Ruta: Again, there was a really excellent team behind this. Sophie was the reveal, so the secrecy surrounding my role in the production was military grade. I was transported to and from my trailer in disguise, even the actors were kept in the dark until the moment we were on set together. This level of secrecy in the “internet spoiler” world was very cool.</p><p>Interviewer: You play the role of Belle (an animal loving neighbor) in A Street Cat Named Bob (film) (Due to be released in November 2016 ). What can you tell us about this production and working with the cast?</p><p>Ruta: James and Bob’s story is incredibly inspiring and uplifting, especially now, when the news we watch every day seems perpetually negative. It’s wonderful to know the simplest of connections, began the process of drawing a man out of his complicated and at times incredibly sad circumstances. James is a great human being. I am so thankful to have spent time with him and Bob and to be involved in telling their story on screen. Luke Treadaway plays James wonderfully, its a really moving performance. It’s always wonderful to have Joanne Froggatt around, she is always excellent and Anthony Head is such a treat. I have a feeling we will all be upstaged by Bob. But. It is his story.</p><h3>About InformationCradle Editorial Staff</h3><p>This Article is produced by <strong>InformationCradle Editorial Staff</strong> which is a team of expert<strong> writers</strong> and <strong>editors</strong> led by <a href=#><strong>Josphat Gachie</strong></a> and trusted by millions of readers worldwide.</p><p>We endeavor to keep our content <strong>True</strong>, <strong>Accurate</strong>, <strong>Correct</strong>, <strong>Original</strong> and <strong>Up to Date</strong>.
