Quarantining amid the <a href=#>ongoing coronavirus pandemic</a> has been stressful for everyone, and with many gyms and restaurants still closed, several stars have been honest about the weight they’ve gained while cooped up inside.</p><p>Take <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>, for example. The <a href=# rel>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> star wasted no time <a href=#>firing back</a> at some Instagram users who questioned whether she was pregnant after she posted <a href=#>a series of bikini photos</a> to the social media platform in May 2020. The E! personality already shares sons <a href=#>Mason</a> and Reign, as well as daughter <a href=#>Penelope</a>, with ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>.</p><p>“This is me when I have a few extra pounds on, and I actually love it,” Kardashian responded while shooting down any pregnancy rumors. “I have given birth three amazing times and this is the shape of my body.”</p><p>Kardashian referenced her <a href=#>epic clapback</a> about a week later during a YouTube discussion with members of her Poosh team.</p><p>“I commented back and said, ‘This is the shape of my body. I gained a few pounds over this quarantine time, and I love my body and I’m proud of my shape and I’m obviously posting it and this is the shape of my body,” she explained. “I don’t think I look pregnant at all.”</p><p>While some celebrities have no problem opening up about a little weight gain, others have made it their mission to stop any extra pounds from piling on. Shortly after the <a href=#>coronavirus quarantine</a> began in March 2020, <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a> stars <a href=#><strong>Jax Taylor</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a> placed a scale directly in front of their refrigerator.</p><p>The <a href=#>funny gimmick</a> was intended to deter the Bravo stars from any unnecessary eating and Taylor shared a peek at it on Twitter using only the 😂 emoji.</p><p>“I need the scale in front of my snack cabinet,” one of the SUR bartender’s Twitter followers declared at the time. Added another: “Love the scale in front of the fridge! I’m stealing that idea.”</p><p>However, while some stars may have put on weight and others are wary of any extra poundage, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">data from Withings</a> — the makers of digital scales — released in May 2020 showed that most people aren’t expanding their waistlines by much.</p><p>According to the France-based company, Americans gained an average of just 0.21 pounds in April 2020, based on anonymous data from more than 100,000 people via the brand’s wifi-enabled scales. Additionally, Withings found that only 37 percent of Americans gained more than a pound.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down to see stars who have been honest about their quarantine weight gain!</p><p><strong>Hear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!</strong><br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2TAta3RrGSgnaRitbC6xKyrZpmSpMK1edCumKuZnqm2r7GMsJyin5ipeqityKdkqaCfqby0ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
