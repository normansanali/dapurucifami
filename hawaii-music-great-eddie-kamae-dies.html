HawaiianLegacyFoundation.org photo</p><p>Musician Eddie Kamae, credited as a pioneer of the resurgence of Hawaiian music, died Saturday on Oahu at age 89.</p><p>A singer, arranger, composer and film producer, Kamae rose to prominence in 1948 as a ukulele virtuoso, according to a news release from Kamae’s Hawaiian Legacy Foundation. He was interested in Hawaiian music and, by 1960, had co-founded the musical group the Sons of Hawai’i, which included Gabby Pahinui, Joe Marshall and David <span class=quotations>“Feets”</span> Rogers.</p><p>The Sons of Hawai’i brought new life to authentic Hawaiian music, including songs written by Queen Lili’uokalani in 1893, according to the foundation.</p><p>Kamae’s style of playing rhythm and melody at the same time helped move the ukulele from a minor background sound to a lead instrument of a new Hawaiian musical sound, according to the foundation.</p><p>Kamae composed some well-known songs in Hawaii, including <span class=quotations>“Morning Dew,”</span> <span class=quotations>“Kela Mea Whiffa”</span> and <span class=quotations>“Ke Ala A Ka Jeep,”</span> according to his foundation. And, with the Sons of Hawai’i, recorded 14 albums.</p><p>At age 59, Kamae began a career as a documentary film director, recording <span class=quotations>“the words and wisdom of Hawaiian elders before they&nbsp; . . . were lost,”</span> according to his foundation. The 10 films have been shown at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., and at film festivals and were distributed to schools throughout Hawaii.</p><p>Inducted into the Hawaiian Music Hall of Fame in 2007, Kamae also received many awards, honors and tribute for his work in <span class=quotations>“preserving Hawaiian language and culture,”</span> according to his foundation. Among his recognitions are the Master of Traditional Arts award from the National Endowment for the Arts and a lifetime achievement award from the Hawaiian Academy of Recording Arts.</p><p>Born Aug. 4, 1927, in Honolulu, Kamae is survived by his wife of 50 years, Myrna; hanai daughters Jo Kamae Byrne and Kathy Mederios; and his brother, Alfred Kamae. A private memorial service is planned.</p><p>For more information, see www.hawaiianlegacyfoundation.org.</p><p>Today's breaking news and more in your inbox</p><a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a> <a href=#></a><p>The Maui News Maui County Department of Finance Director Scott Teruya was placed on administrative leave on last ...</p><a href=#></a><p>Holy Innocents Episcopal Church, formerly on Front Street in Lahaina Town and destroyed by the fire, announced the ...</p><a href=#></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3UoqWer6NjsLC5jqecsKtfobykrctmpZ6vo2R%2FcX2WaGdqZ5iWxKK1yGakrquZmHqovsSaq2adlJm2pnnKmqSanV2Ztqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
