I feel like a lot of people are going to tune in just to have something to say, and when they finally listen to it, they’re going to like it,” she said.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>She continued: “Right now, it feels like there’s a lot of people doubting us. It’s just a bitter time for a lot of people coming out of the lockdown and people feel so entitled and opinionated and it’s just popular to be hateful right now. I won’t say that people are just hating on us, I just see a lot of hate in the world. I hope that this album puts fun back into music from our direction. I hope it makes them fall back in love with us.”</p><p>RAW is the third studio album from the Miami duo, and features appearances from the likes of Usher (on the previously-released “Good Love”), Lil Durk, Muni Long, Juicy J and Kim Petras. It follows 2020’s City On Lock album – which suffered a leak before it was even announced, leading to the girls dropping it earlier than planned. The album debuted at No. 29 on the Billboard 200.</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/06/city-girls-i-need-a-thug-pinata-250x142.jpg alt="City Girls Introduce ‘Elevated P-ssy Rap’ With Two New Tracks" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>City Girls Introduce ‘Elevated P-ssy Rap’ With Two New Tracks</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>June 9, 2023</p></a><p>In a recent clip, <a href=# rel=noopener>Yung Miami</a> revisited the album and opened up about why thinking about its release still triggers her. It was released during a tragic time in her life which saw the <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>murder of her ex-boyfriend Jai Wiggins</a>, father to her now pre-teen son.</p><p>“Whenever I think about that [album], it just make me depressed,” she told JT in a clip Miami posted on Instagram, shot at New York City’s Quad Studios. “Like when I go to try to think about that time. The album had to be rolled out at that time. So when you said that, that would be a triggering point that’ll make me cry.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>JT responded: “I feel like for death, it be a never-ending cycle.”</p><p>Miami continued, “Me, personally, I get worse over time. For me because I got a child, it’s every time a holiday come. Him going to football practice will be triggering for me. Just to imagine the person not having their father.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0miaoqypYrSqvsusZKuZp2Kura7UpqlmpZWWtKa%2BjJ%2Bgq6ukYsSmscpmqpqklag%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
