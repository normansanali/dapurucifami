I always think about that whenever I write about Blake and Leo these days. Obviously, Blake has great game, and she’s made it her priority to stay Leo’s girlfriend for the foreseeable future. I’m not sure if any of that screams “playing hard to get” as much as it screams “Blake is holding out for a ring.” I blame Kate Middleton. It seems like when Kate got the ring, thousands of girls looked at that moment and said, “If she can focus all of her energy for nine years on getting the ring, so can I!” Which seems to be a good jumping off point for this story – Blake doesn’t want to just be Leo’s girlfriend. She wants to be his WIFE. And she’s willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.</p><p>Blake Lively and Leonardo DiCaprio have only been an item since May, but according to a new report, the “Green Lantern” actress already has a plan: To marry Leo!</p><p>“She wants to land Leo as a husband,” a source claims to Life & Style magazine. “Everything Blake tells me says Leo is serious. They are making plans together and acting like a serious couple.”</p><p>In fact, Blake is so smitten with her new beau, says Life & Style, that she’s decided to rent a house “a couple of blocks away” from his Hollywood Hills home.</p><p>“She needed a place in L.A. and decided to live as close to Leo as she could,” a source tells Life & Style. “I don’t think she could have gotten a place any closer. She’s jumping in feet first.”</p><p>And Blake is so determined to keep Leo, that she’s just trying to keep off the weight she lost for “Green Lantern,” reports Life & Style. “If you look at the other girls Leo dated, like Gisele [Bundchen] and Bar [Refaeli], it’s clear he likes his ladies in great shape. Blake is very aware of that.”</p><p>For “Green Lantern,” Blake enlisted celeb trainer Bobby Strom to help her lose 14 pounds and two dresses sizes.</p><p>While Blake and Leo have stepped out together, making no secret of their romance, don’t expect it to end: “Blake is really into Leo,” says the Life & Style source, “and is making it obvious.”</p><p>[From <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a>]</p><p>I hope Blake doesn’t lose any more weight. I’ve always defended her looks whenever you guys made fun of her, but I really do think she’s pretty and sexy, in a very accessible, Mall Girl kind of way. BUT – when she loses weight, some of it comes off of her face, and she looks kind of drag queeny. Plus, she’s already naturally very slender/athletic, and I would rather have her figure than Gisele’s or Bar’s. Why starve yourself into looking like a twig? Perhaps Duchess Kate is to blame for that as well.</p><p>As for Blake wanting to land Leo, officially and all… well, good luck to her. I don’t think it’s going to happen, but I applaud her efforts, mostly because I want to see her try.</p><p>Sidenote: Blake’s been wearing a lot of white lately. I see your game, Blake, but I worry that you’re going to end up looking like Miss Havisham.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/fp_7328381_pal_dicapriolively_spielbergyacht_24_29.jpg alt=fp_7328381_pal_dicapriolively_spielbergyacht_24_29 title=fp_7328381_pal_dicapriolively_spielbergyacht_24_29 width=543 height=640 sizes="(max-width: 543px) 100vw, 543px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wenn3431377.jpg alt=wenn3431377 title=wenn3431377 width=560 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wenn3431358.jpg alt=wenn3431358 title=wenn3431358 width=560 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/wenn3431363.jpg alt=wenn3431363 title=wenn3431363 width=560 sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of WENN.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmam5oaH14e8uslpukkaCyoLjIr5ylsY%2Bsrq%2FA0pirqJeclrulq8uepqeZopm8oLDInJipqpmkrKK%2FvpqWoa2jl66vsI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
