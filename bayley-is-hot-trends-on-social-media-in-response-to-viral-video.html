Whenever she aims to incite the crowd, there’s no shortage of fans for her to taunt. It appears that fans have also figured out a way to get back at her a bit.</p><p><a href=#>As we previously reported</a>, Bayley was not too happy to see a sign at a recent WWE live event that said: “Bayley Is Hot.” This prompted quite a trend on social media.</p><p>Bayley responded to a fan’s sign incident that occurred at a house show in Allentown, PA on December 2nd. She was in a match against Shotzi during the live event and, despite her best efforts, couldn’t secure a victory against the SmackDown star. A video circulating on social media documented the incident when Bayley took a young fan’s sign and paraded around with it at ringside. Then, Bayley tore up the sign, and she was seen laughing at the fan holding the torn pieces.</p><p>Social media obviously saw this clip, and they want to get under the Damage CTRL leader’s skin. Of course, the Internet Wrestling Community ran with this idea in a big way.</p><p>“Bayley Is Hot” is now trending on social media. Plenty of fans are posting photos and videos of Bayley, along with #BayleyIsHot with it. Naturally, those posts are getting loads of engagement.</p><p>It’s unclear how Bayley will feel about this viral trend of fans proclaiming her hotness. Since she is a heel, odds are she will act very unhappy about this. That being said, it’s hard to imagine that it isn’t flattering in some way.</p><p>You can heck out some of the posts about how hot Bayley is below. We will have plenty more stories like this, and so much more, right here at <a href=#>Ringside News</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>What’s your take on Bayley?
