In 2017, the kicker was also awarded CFL East All-Star Punter.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brett becomes the first player in history to miss four points in a game</h2><p>The Cowboys’ place kicker is nowadays being trolled on the internet for his poor performance in the last few games.&nbsp;</p><p>He is not having the best season of his life since he missed four straight points in Monday’s game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.</p><p>The incident made Brett the first player in NFL history to miss four points straight in a game since 1932.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite him having a bad game, the team went on to win 31-14 against the rivals Buccaneers. Brett finally scored on his fifth attempt in the fourth quarter.</p><p>Cowboys owner <a href=#>Jerry Jones</a> on Brett’s misses: “<strong>I was worried about what those extra points might do toward winning this game, and when I got by that, I’m not going to worry about them anymore</strong>.”</p><p>On the first two kicks, Maher put it wide on the right. The third one he put wide left and the fourth one hit the right upright. On his fifth attempt, he placed an accurate kick right down the middle.</p><p>After the game, Maher said, “<strong>Really happy for my team. It was a huge win for us. Couldn’t play my part tonight. This team is doing great moving forward. Just get back at it this week.</strong>”</p><p>Maher’s bad game doesn’t change the fact that he played as one of the most solid players on the field (going 29-of-32 (90.6%)) this season.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCu0Z6rrWWdlrWmvoywoJ%2BdXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
