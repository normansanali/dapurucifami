Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) fired Nate over what he perceived as a betrayal, but maybe the latest Newman storyline could give Nate a chance to redeem himself.</p><p>After the fake mental decline trap was set, Nate enraged Victor by trying to send him out of town for treatment and calling ahead to set everything up.</p><p>From where Victor was standing, it seemed like power-hungry Nate was trying to ship him off so that Nate could help Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle) run things instead.</p><p>Nate suggested he was thinking like a doctor and said he genuinely believed that was the best course of action for Victor.</p><p>Now Nate might end up in a situation where he’s forced to play doctor once again – but with more appreciative results!</p><p>Y&R fans know things have been off between Nate and Victoria ever since she sided with Adam, but he obviously still cares about her.</p><p>The longer Victoria is missing, the more likely it becomes that Nate will grow concerned and help with a new search.</p><p>If Adam and Nate figure out the lake house’s location, they might barge in and ambush Aunt Jordan (Colleen Zenk) along with Claire Grace (Hayley Erin).</p><p>It’d be helpful for Adam to have Nate as backup in this case. That’s especially true since <a href=# rel=noopener>Nate has medical skills that could come in quite handy.</a></p><p>Jordan will claim she’s given Victor, Victoria and Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow) poisoned water that could cause fatal heart attacks, so Nate might have to put those medical skills to good use.</p><p>If Nate and Adam have an opportunity to play the hero together, that could score them both some redemption points.</p><p>Nate could even be offered his old job back at Newman Enterprises, but he might still turn it down and focus on rejoining Chancellor-Winters.</p><p>It seems like Nate’s determined to become part of his own family business again.</p><p>That said, Nate could still pitch in on the Newman rescue and perhaps make peace with them after this ordeal.</p><p>The danger Victoria lands in could also remind Nate of how deeply he’s fallen for her, so maybe they could reignite their spark.</p><p>As for Adam, his possible role in this rescue could actually shut down Victoria, Nick and Nikki Newman’s (Melody Thomas Scott) complaints for a while.</p><p>Victor would be unbelievably proud of Adam for coming through when it counted!</p><p>The Young and the Restless spoilers say Nikki, Victor, Nick and Victoria will face a dire situation, so stay tuned for updates on any good news that might be headed their way.</p><p>CDL will have other thrilling <a href=# rel=noopener>Young and the Restless spoilers, news and updates to read up on, so drop by regularly for more Y&R details.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybsXOrqWgZZGjsW7Ax55kq52jqbmmv9JmqqmnmaGys7%2BMmpuapV2jrrWxjKysq6iinsCmedGeqpytlWLBpq3MZpimmqWotW6vy5qgq51dlsKvwIyjpquckaN8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
