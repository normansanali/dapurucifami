And so I get up to first class and I look at him and he’s sitting on the window side so I sort of have to reach over a person and say, ‘Quentin, Quentin, <a href=#>I’m in this DCOM called Minutemen</a> and it just came out and here’s the ad! That’s me!’”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The <a href=#>Succession</a> actor noted that the advertisement, which featured the longline “zero to hero,” was three guys — <a href=#>Braun, Dolley, and Benward</a> — “flying through time because they created a time travel machine” to go from “dorks to heroes.” It was a premise that the Prom star couldn’t help but share with the Kill Bill director.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“So I’m like, ‘Quentin, that’s me in this movie and I really hope to work with you someday.

I remember <a href=#>I asked if I could go in [for the part]</a>, and my agent reached out and came back and was basically like, ‘They just don’t see you for it. They don’t think you can play nerdy.’ I was like, bump that. I’m going in. I’m going full in,” the Ravenswood alum shared. “I came in with a butt part where I slicked it back, I went all out, I may have even changed my voice a little bit. Then I found out that last minute, they had someone in mind and I came in and Charlie Tuttled out. But I love that character.”</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>He added, “Disney fit the mold much better for growing with my craft.
