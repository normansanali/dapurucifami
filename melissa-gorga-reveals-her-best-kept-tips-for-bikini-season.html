I would tend to stick away from [it] if I know I’ve got to put a bikini on the next day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melissa-Gorga-Reveals-Her-Best-Kept-Tips-for-Bikini-Season.jpg><p dir=ltr>Gorga said that she’s “huge” on consuming “so much” water, adding, “I pee a lot because I drink a lot of water. So I feel like I’m constantly running to the bathroom because I just drink so much water. So … I know it’s such, like, a cliche, but it’s so true. It’s one of the truest things for your skin and for the flush out your body.”</p><p dir=ltr>The businesswoman <a href=#>is keen on staying in shape</a>, regardless of <a href=#>whether she plans on slipping into a bikini</a>. Gorga told Us that she will “stay very consistent” with her workouts by typically exercising four to five days a week.</p><p dir=ltr>Additionally, Gorga will <a href=#>make sure to “always” put pure zinc all over her face</a>. “I actually look funny because if you ever see me out in my backyard or at the beach, my face is always pure white and <a href=#>I will put, like, [SPF] 30 on my skin</a>,” she explained. “I just naturally have, you know, olive skin. So it gets dark, but I usually put, like, a [SPF] 15 to 30 on my body, but my chest and my face are always covered in zinc.”</p><p dir=ltr>The Bravo vet continued, “I always say this: ladies, your chest right here shows your age quicker than your face. ‘Cause we know you’re all getting botox. … You gotta cover your chest and your neck the way that you would cover your face. I feel like it is so important. It’s a dead giveaway with women that I meet that have been in the sun their whole lives and, like, baking out in their backyard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Melissa-Gorga-Jokes-About-Parenting-Vicious-Teenager-Daughter-1.jpg><p dir=ltr>Gorga also admitted to being a long-sufferer of razor bumps near her bikini area. To resolve this matter, she has used <a href=#>Bikini Zone</a>’s anti-bump shave gel.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr>“This product is so good and helps smooth out your skin so much. It takes away the redness [and] all the irritation,” she shared. “So I’ve been really, honestly, sharing it with everyone in my family too that I love [it] and it’s inexpensive. It’s $8. So it’s really inexpensive and it really works and the redness has gone [away]. So I’ve been so happy with it.”</p><p dir=ltr>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGamnZyewLStjKCmq5%2BRYr%2BmwsSao6xlmJq%2Fbq7ErKtmo5WlwW7AyKmqZp6fp3qjtcqipaJlo5qutLvNaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
