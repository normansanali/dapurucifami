During a recent interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>GQ</a>, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>two-time Emmy-nominated actress</a> opened up about feeling the need to defy people’s perceptions of her, which she said are often based on her body, by working extra hard to break the stereotype.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had boobs before other girls and I felt ostracized for it,” she shared. “I was embarrassed and I never wanted to change in the locker room. I think that I put on this weird persona other people had of me because of my body.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, “So I did play every sport and I studied really hard and I did everything that people wouldn’t think I would do, to show them that my body doesn’t define who I am,” adding that she still feels the same way today, but on a “whole-world scale.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sweeney also opened up during the interview about watching the online reaction to her Euphoria nude scenes play out in real time. “It got to the point where they were tagging my family. My cousins don’t need that. It’s completely disgusting and unfair,” she said of social media users screenshotting the episodes and sharing them online. “You have a character that goes through the scrutiny of being a sexualized person at school and then an audience that does the same thing.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While entirely frustrating, Sydney explained that she refuses to let trolls bother her when asked if these internet reactions make her want to “hide herself away.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Not anymore,” she admitted. “I think it’s ridiculous. I’m an artist, I play characters. It makes me want to play characters that piss people off more.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570rKbp52pYsC4scSnnLJlkqSxunnDqJyspqRisaayyKecZqCVp3qovYyipa2doqu2psOMb29rcGFugg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
