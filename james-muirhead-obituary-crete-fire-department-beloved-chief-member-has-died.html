Chief Muirhead went suddenly at 4:56 a.m. today, a victim of an unforeseen and fatal medical condition.</p><p>Chief Muirhead’s 34-year career as a firefighter was defined by unflagging commitment and a deep commitment to saving lives. When he joined the Crete Fire Department in July of 2022, he began his incredible career.</p><p>Prior to his stint in Crete, he served as a paid-on-call firefighter at the Matteson Fire Department. He started out as a firefighter in the Crete Township Fire Protection District, and his dedication and ability to lead eventually earned him the position of Lieutenant. He is now the Deputy Chief of the Riverdale Fire Department.</p><p>Chief Muirhead left an indelible mark on the Crete Fire Department and the fire service as a whole throughout his illustrious career. His selfless dedication to protecting the community and his fellow firefighters was an example to all.</p><p>Chief Muirhead played a crucial role in the department’s hiring and training of new officers by serving as a mentor, adviser, and friend to many. His leadership, passion, generosity, and sense of humor made an indelible mark on all who were fortunate enough to work with him.</p><p>We respectfully ask that the community remember Chief Muirhead’s family in their prayers as they struggle to cope with their loss. As soon as arrangements for memorial services are finalized, information will be made accessible to the general public.</p><p>Chief James “JP” Muirhead will be sorely missed in the Village of Crete, and for that we are eternally grateful. Never again will he forget the woman whose heart he has touched, but the woman whose heart he has not yet forgotten. Chief Muirhead, you are greatly missed, and your memory will live on in the flame of your legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZbDprrLsmSmnZ2kv6qty6xlnKedZLeiucSsZKatmae1pq3DZqaboaSqrrPFjJypnqyVYrOqvsRmm56okafBrrHNrWSbnZykw6awjJyfop2WYrqmucGeqWagkah6pbXEnWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
