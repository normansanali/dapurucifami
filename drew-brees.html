He has earned more than $244 million throughout his career.</p><h2>Drew Brees | Education and Early Childhood</h2><p>Drew was born in Dallas, Texas, on 15 January 1979. He is the eldest son of Eugene Wilson “Chip” Brees II, a well-known trial lawyer, and Mina Ruth (nee Akins), a lawyer. Reid Brees is his younger brother.</p><p>Drew comes from a family of athletes. His father was a member of the Texas A&M men’s basketball team, and his mother was a former all-state performer in three high school sports.</p><p>His maternal grandfather, Ray Akins, is one of the best high school football coaches in Texas history, and his uncle, Marty Akins, was a 1975 Southwest Conference All-Southwest Conference quarterback. Reid, his pal, was a Baylor Bears baseball outfielder. Additionally, his grandfather participated in the Battle of Okinawa.</p><p>When he was seven years old, his parents split and shared custody of the children. Though Drew and his brother were going through a tough time, the whole situation made the brothers together. They have a half-sister named Audrey as a result of their father’s remarriage to Amy Hightower, the daughter of former United States Representative Jack English Hightower.</p><p>Drew enrolled in 1993 at Westlake High School. He excelled in basketball, baseball, and football during his high school years. His senior season was in the fall of 1996, and he led the club to an undefeated regular-season record and a state championship.</p><p>Drew enrolled at Purdue University and continued his quarterback career. He helped the Boilermakers win a Big Ten Championship and a trip to the Rose Bowl during his four years. He earned a bachelor’s degree in industrial management in 2001 and was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.</p><h2>Drew Brees | Height, Weight, and Appearance</h2><p>Drew is 41 years old, and his zodiac sign is Capricorn, since he was born on 15 January.

His career is detailed below.</p><p><strong>Football at the high school level</strong></p><p>He considered playing college baseball initially, but after blowing out his knee, his prospects changed. In 1995, as a sophomore, he transitioned to quarterback. He was, however, not your average quarterback; he was shorter and much thinner than most quarterbacks. His arm, on the other hand, was the hero; whenever he made a throw, it flew straight, real, and strong.</p><p>He was named the 1996 Most Valuable Offensive Player during his junior year. He coached his high school football team to an undefeated season and state championship. Drew completed 314 of 490 passes for 5461 yards and 50 touchdowns (64.1 percent). He was a member of the state high school football all-star team and the All-USA high school football formation.</p><p><strong>Football in College</strong></p><p>Drew shone brightly as a junior. He was a key member of Joe Tiller and Jim Chaney’s unconventional “basketball on grass” spread offense during his junior and senior years, serving as offensive captain. Brees was offered a spot in the 2000 NFL Draft during his junior year but chose to stay for his senior year to finish his studies.</p><p>He led the Boilermakers to their first Big Ten title since 1967 in 2000. Purdue earned an invitation to the 2001 Rose Bowl, their first visit since 1967, as a result of the victory.</p><p>Drew set two NCAA records, 13 Big Ten Conference records, and 19 Purdue University records during his college career. He set numerous records with 11792 passing yards, 90 touchdown passes, 12,693 total offensive yards, 1026 completions, and 1678 attempts. He was inducted into Purdue’s Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame in 2009.</p><h2>Chargers de San Diego</h2><p>Drew was the first selection in the second round of the 2001 NFL draft by the San Diego Chargers. He began as Doug Flutie’s backup. Brees&nbsp; was later designated starter. He started 15 games and led the team to a 12-4 regular-season record in 2004.</p><p>Drew was named to the 2004 Pro Bowl after the San Diego Chargers won the AFC West for the first time in ten seasons. He was named the National Football League’s Comeback Player of the Year in 2004.</p><p>Drew retained his starting quarterback status for the 2005 season. He set a career high with 3576 passing yards. However, he was injured and tore his labrum in his most recent game.</p><h2>Saints de New Orleans</h2><p>Drew began searching for other teams after the 2005 season after becoming dissatisfied with the San Diego Chargers’ bid. He signed a six-year, $60 million contract with the New Orleans Saints on 14 March 2006. In 2011, he set an NFL record with 5476 passing yards and a career-high 46 touchdowns.</p><p>The New Orleans Saints beat the Indianapolis Colts 31-17 in Super Bowl XLIV on 7 February 2010. Drew was named the Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl. He completed 288 passes for 288 yards and two touchdowns. He was named Sports Illustrated’s Sportsman of the Year for 2010.</p><p>Drew managed to set new milestones over the next decade. He broke NFL records for completions and passing yards in 2018. Additionally, he completed a career-high 74.4 percent of his throws and was selected to his 12th Pro Bowl. He has a two-year, $50 million contract extension with the New Orleans Saints until 2020.</p><h2>Drew Brees | Earnings</h2><p>Drew is one of the NFL’s all-time great quarterbacks. Brees has set several records and won hundreds of millions of dollars throughout his 19-year career. He signed a two-year deal worth $50 million with the New Orleans Saints in March 2020, including a $23 million signing bonus. Drew has earned more than $244 million throughout his career.</p><h2>Personal Life of Drew Brees</h2><p>Drew married Brittany Dudchenko, his college girlfriend, in February 2003. They have four children together: three sons, Baylen, Bowen, and Callen, who were born in January 2009, October 2010, and August 2012, respectively, and one daughter, Rylen, who was born in August 2014.</p><p>He and his family reside in Uptown New Orleans. They relocated there after Hurricane Katrina’s destruction. Drew made significant contributions to the New Orleans community after the disaster.</p><p>He has visited Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, Germany, Turkey, Djibouti, Dubai, Okinawa, and Guantanamo Bay on five USO journeys.</p><p>Drew’s life revolves around four pillars: religion, family, football, and philanthropy. He is a Christian. Drew is a Democrat.</p><h2>Protest of the National Anthem</h2><p>Drew maintained his 2016 position that kneeling during the national anthem was disrespectful to the flag and the United States on June 3, 2020, during the George Floyd demonstrations. Numerous athletes expressed dissatisfaction and outrage over the remark. He apologised the next day.</p><h2>Foundation for the Brees Dream</h2><p>In 2003, Drew and his wife Brittany founded the Brees Dream Foundation. It was founded in memory of Brittany’s aunt, who died of cancer, to assist cancer patients and conduct research. They have since broadened their horizons by assisting with Hurricane Katrina recovery efforts and providing treatment, education, and resources for children and families in need. Drew and Brittany also donated more than $33,000,000 to help those in need.</p><p>They revealed plans to donate $5 million to charities that will assist Louisiana families during the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. They collaborated with Ochsner Health System in July 2020 and contributed $5 million through the Brees Dream Foundation to assist in the construction of various healthcare facilities in Louisiana.</p><h2>Presence on Social Media</h2><p>3.2 million followers on Twitter</p><p>1.7 million followers on Instagram</p><h2>Frequently Asked Question</h2><h3>Drew Brees has won how many Super Bowls?</h3><p>Drew Brees has one Super Bowl victory to his credit; the New Orleans Saints claimed Super Bowl XLIV.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table><tbody><tr><td><b>Full Name</b></td><td>Andrew Christopher Brees</td></tr><tr><td><b>Birth Date</b></td><td>15 January 1979</td></tr><tr><td><b>Birth Place</b></td><td>Dallas, Texas, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td><b>Zodiac Sign</b></td><td>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nick Name</b></td><td>Drew Brees</td></tr><tr><td><b>Religion</b></td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td><b>Nationality</b></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><b>Ethnicity</b></td><td>White</td></tr><tr><td><b>Father’s Name</b></td><td>Eugene Wilson “Chip” Brees II</td></tr><tr><td><b>Mother’s Name</b></td><td>Mina Ruth (nee Akins)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Siblings</b></td><td>Reid Brees (Younger Brother), Audrey Brees (Half-sister)</td></tr><tr><td><b>Education</b></td><td>Westlake High school; Purdue University</td></tr><tr><td><b>Age</b></td><td>42 Years Old</td></tr><tr><td><b>Height</b></td><td>6 ft. 0 in.
