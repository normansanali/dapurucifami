Her two looks were totally different, but we can't get enough of them so we tracked them down, just for you! SHOP. This summer there are so many sexy swimsuit trends to choose from, making it even easier to find the best look for your body type -- and it looks like Nina Dobrev is having fun trying on all of the silhouettes of the season! The star knows how to make a splash, and she did just that when she was photographed enjoying some fun in the sun while on a yacht in St. Tropez, France, on vacation, where she rocked both a one-piece bathing suit and a colorful bikini -- but which look did you like better?</p><figure class="entry-media edge-to-edge entry-media--lead-video"></figure><p id=content-paragraph-1><span id=more-1783182></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Nina served up major summer style inspiration while on vacation — we can’t get enough of her beach babe looks. She first rocked a black one-piece bathing suit by Issa ‘de Mar. The Kenya one-piece features a sexy, detailed high neckline and a streamlined silhouette, which gave way to a low back — it’s definitely not your typical one-piece! Aside from the fact that it’s a great choice for a beach vacation or pool party, you can aslo take the silhouette from day-to-night. Simply pair it with a high-waisted skirt or trousers and it’ll double as a sexy bodysuit! How hot is that?</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Nina has a great bikini body, (and she didn’t hesitate when it came time to show it off!), I love that she switched up her style with the one-piece bathing suit — not only is this silhouette seriously having a moment, but it looked sexy, sleek and chic on the star.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Nina also donned a colorful bikini on vacation when she stepped out in the Issa ‘de Mar Hono top. The tribal bikini top features a black and white pattern and contrasting purple straps — and we love the pop of color in this look! Want to rock it? You can shop for Nina’s exact bikini top right HERE for $84.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>What do you think of Nina’s vacation style?
