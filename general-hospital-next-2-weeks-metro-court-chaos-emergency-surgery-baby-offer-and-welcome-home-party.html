During the week of July 3-7, Cyrus Renault (Jeff Kober) will recruit Drew to be on his team behind bars, but Drew could face trouble whether he complies or resists.</p><p>There’ll be a repeat on Tuesday, July 4, but the show will quickly resume with all-new episodes and plenty of shockers.</p><p>Felicia Scorpio (Kristina Wagner) will launch the investigation Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring) pushed for, so she’ll soon uncover some surprising red flags about Martin Grey (Michael E. Knight).</p><p>Over with Tracy Quartermaine (Jane Elliot), she set up a meeting with Diane Miller (Carolyn Hennesy).</p><p>Tracy might explore legal options regarding “Eddie Maine” aka Ned Quartermaine (Wally Kurth) – like having him committed if possible.</p><p>At Deception, Brook Lynn Quartermaine (Amanda Setton) will have to think fast after Lucy realizes confidential info has been stolen.</p><p>We’ll see Brook Lynn spin a story about trying to be a more informed employee – and she’ll play dumb about knowing there were trade secrets in the files she copied.</p><p>After Molly Lansing-Davis (currently played by Holiday Mia Kriegel) confides in Kristina Corinthos-Davis (Kate Mansi), she’ll get an offer that catches her off guard.</p><p>Molly will mull that offer over during the week of July 10-14, so this probably involves Kristina suggesting she could have a baby for TJ Ashford (Tajh Bellow) and her sister.</p><p>Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn) will likely think this is another one of Kristina’s wild ideas that she won’t follow through on or will end up regretting.</p><p>Offering to have a baby for someone is a huge deal, so Alexis will deliver a warning and may worry that Kristina doesn’t know what she’s signing up for.</p><p>Kristina will get the brush off later, so Molly may not be ready to give her an answer.</p><p>The fact that Kristina even offers at all could leave Molly a little freaked out and distant until she processes everything.</p><p>Next, let’s talk about Josslyn Jacks (Eden McCoy) and something she’ll witness.</p><p>Josslyn will see a sight she disapproves of and will eventually confront Esme Prince (Avery Pohl), so she may suspect Esme is trying to steal Trina Robinson’s (Tabyana Ali) boyfriend.</p><p>Perhaps Josslyn will spot a close moment between Esme and Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Alexander Chavez), which could lead to her telling Esme to stop all her manipulation.</p><p>Over with Elizabeth Baldwin (Rebecca Herbst) and Hamilton Finn (Michael Easton), they’ll get honest about their mutual feelings and hopefully decide whether they’re going to try pursuing a romance again.</p><p>While Lucy and Felicia kick off a fun caper, Cody Bell (Josh Kelly) will do his best to get the upper hand on Selina Wu (Lydia Look).</p><p>That sounds like a terrible idea since Selina has proven she’s not easily outwitted!</p><p>There’ll also be a scary ordeal at the Metro Court after someone fires a shot.</p><p>Nina Reeves (Cynthia Watros) will face some horror, but Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) will apparently stay safe since his children will keep going about their business.</p><p>Michael Corinthos (Chad Duell) will pull off a grand gesture for Willow Corinthos (Katelyn MacMullen), who’ll be able to return to the gatehouse after some positive updates at the hospital.</p><p>Willow will even invite Nina to be part of her tiny welcome home party, but Nina will have to play nice with Carly Spencer (Laura Wright) to be included.</p><p>As for the victim from the Metro Court, that person will cling to life at GH.</p><p>TJ Ashford (Tajh Bellow) will help out with emergency surgery, but good news should follow.</p><p>This could tie in with Ava Jerome (Maura West) and Austin Gatlin-Holt’s storyline (Roger Howarth), especially if Austin saves Ava from Mason Gatlin-Holt (Nathanyael Grey) and puts his own life on the line.</p><p>Trina will get hit with some big emotions, so that may involve reconnecting with Ava after the crisis and seeing that she’s OK.</p><p>Harrison Chase (Josh Swickard) will make an arrest before the week’s over while Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) settles a new theory, so the PCPD will be hard at work!</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say the next two weeks will bring some action-packed episodes, so stay tuned.</p><p>CDL’s the place to be for terrific <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so pop back in soon for more GH details.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2alnrCkYn9uw8SeoqxlnZrBs7uMnKauqqRisKmtzqxknqWVp7SmusKyZKytopyys8WMm5ibsV2ks6ex0WaYp5xdrLKtr86mnGagn6KybrzAq6uyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
