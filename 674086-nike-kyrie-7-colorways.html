Unfortunately, the controversial split between Irving and Nike led to the brand canceling the release of the Kyrie 8. Though fans were disappointed in the split, the Nike Kyrie 7 was a great shoe to end the legacy. Also, fans received no shortage of variants to choose from. From the bright and colorful “Weatherman” to the art-inspired “Expressions," the colorways of this sneaker kept fans hyped for their releases. Here are the seven best Nike Kyrie 7 colorways!</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-expressions>“Expressions”</h2></span><p>Off the court, Kyrie Irving is a known art lover, keeping an extensive collection of artwork at his home. Irving’s love for art is said to be the main inspiration behind this vibrant colorway. The love and appreciation for art appear on the heel in the form of lateral panels and paint splatter graphics. A pink pastel sole blends with the shoe’s bright multicolored, brush-stroke-styled upper. The orange swooshes, lavender shoe strings, and coral-colored treading bring even more vibrant color to the shoe. The tan, canvas-inspired, tongue tops off the look of a sneaker that perfectly pays homage to your inner artist!&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-weatherman>“Weatherman”</h2></span><p>These kicks are ready to dominate in any weather! Taking inspiration from another signature Nike sneaker line, <a href=# rel>the Nike Kyrie 7 “Weatherman”</a> takes inspiration from the Nike KD4 “Weatherman.” This colorway sports an eye-catching vibrant Stadium Green upper with an all-black sole and Nike swoosh. The multicolor heat map graphic highlighting the heel, inner lining, and rubber outsole adds even more color to the sneaker. Just like the KD4 colorway it draws inspiration from, the “Weatherman” is one of the most popular variants of the Nike Kyrie 7.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-hendrix>“Hendrix”</h2></span><p>Also dubbed “Creator,” the “Hendrix” colorway evokes the psychedelic spirit of the legendary <a href=# rel>rockstar Jimi Hendrix</a>. Kyrie’s All-Seeing Eye motifs cover the sneaker's dark purple mesh upper. The warp pattern on the rear heel panels adds to the trippy effect of the colorway. The midnight green tongue and sole unit sporting black, grey, and red complete the look of the psychedelic sneaker. The vibrant tones of this nod to Hendrix make this colorway one of the hottest!</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sneaker-room-x-nike-kyrie-7-mom>Sneaker Room x Nike Kyrie 7 'Mom'</h2></span><p>This mismatched colorway was made to honor the late mothers of Kyrie Irving and Sneaker Room owner Suraj Kaufman. Taking inspiration from the elements of Mother Nature, one colorway represents Earth, while the contrast represents other elements. The green and yellow colorway represents earth and wind, while the blue and orange iteration represents fire and ice. Both colorways feature Sneaker Room and “Mom” branding on the lace tips. Each sneaker has a flower graphic on the hell, as well as “In honor of” on the heel panel. The details in this collaboration make it one of the most unique versions of the Nike Kyrie 7.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-world-1-people>“1 World 1 People”</h2></span><p>This popular colorway follows a positive theme of peace. The “1 World 1 People” colorway has the same namesake message featured on the sneaker's heel. Touches of aqua blue compliment the bright yellow-clad mesh upper. The TPU fins of the sneaker have the same touches of blue. The TPU fins also come in bright red as well. Tones of red and green are also present on the colorful set. The colorway's bright tones are completed with an abstract multicolor print over the sneaker.&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-visions>“Visions”</h2></span><p>This colorway draws inspiration from Irving’s hobbies off the court. On the heel of the sneaker is “sports,” “music,” “film,” and “art,” listing off the favorite interests of the athlete. The white, lace-like mesh upper compliments the rest of the multicolored sneaker. The lime green midsole brings a serious pop of color. The red and blue TPU fins match the red and blue Nike Swooshes and Irving’s blue trademark logo on the tongue. A cool nod to the baller’s other passions, this multicolored variant of the Nike Kyrie 7 was a hot choice among sneakerheads!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-final-rings>“Final Rings”</h2></span><p>Even though Kyrie Irving didn’t get a ring in 2021, the Nike Kyrie 7's “Final Rings” colorway is fit for a championship occasion. The metallic gold, black, and grey combination looks phenomenal against the mesh white silhouette. The championship ring-inspired colorway sports other incredible details as well. The graphics in the mesh upper gives the white base a royal tone. Behind the sneaker's heel lies the unique symbol, Irving’s “ All Seeing Eye” logo, placed on a championship ring. The champion-level designs provide a strong statement for the shoe's sleek and exciting silhouette. The cool look of the Nike Kyrie 7 “Final Rings” makes this colorway a must-cop for sneaker fans.&nbsp;</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>][<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmbIFxhJVmpaKjlWK4ur7InmRwZZOkubC%2B1pqwrA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
