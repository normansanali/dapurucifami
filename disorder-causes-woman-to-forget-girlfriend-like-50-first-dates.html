She’s taken to documenting her experience with it on TikTok, where she has more than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">332,000 followers</a>.</p><p>Her girlfriend, 22-year-old Tara Sorkin, has developed an assortment of sweet methods to help jog Jackson’s memory, including maintaining a diary for her, taking her to places she’s been before and recently celebrating Valentine’s Day multiple times.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-default">Megan Jackson’s girlfriend has developed a number of ways to help jog her memory following a seizure.<span class=credit>Jam Press</span></figure><p>“We’ve only been together a few months and we’ve been through way too much. We shouldn’t have been through this amount of trauma and I’ve forgotten her at least four times,” Jackson told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the Mirror</a>. “It’s like ‘50 First Dates.’ Everyone refers to it like that.”</p><p>Sometimes, following a seizure and resultant memory wiping, Jackson will be told “this is your girlfriend, Tara” and will respond with confusion.</p><p>“I’ll be like ‘What the hell — I’m not even gay,’” she told the publication. Due to her chronic condition, she believes it’s impossible to truly know her sexuality, “because I’ve forgotten.”</p><figure class="alignright size-nypost-inline-default">Megan Jackson.<span class=credit>Kennedy News and Media</span></figure><p>Perhaps the cruelest part of FND is that it is triggered by extreme emotions, including happiness.</p><p>“It’s so depressing. I have seizures pretty much every day,” she said. “I only need to laugh then I have a fit. It affects every part of my life.”</p><p>Particularly funny or sad TV programs can trigger her FND, as can stress. Attempting to suppress a seizure, she said, only makes it worse — “You’ve got to ride it out.”</p><p>Her condition has made it difficult to maintain traditional employment.</p><p>“I can’t work. I’ve been let go by so many jobs,” she said</p><p>This month, Jackson launched a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GoFundMe</a> so she can afford private health care instead of the care offered through the UK’s public National Health Service.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnlJ7AsL7Dnqlmm5GqwKa%2FjLCmppmeYsGwecWoqaCdpGK0qr7Ln6minZ6Zeq21yp5kbmhdm7azv9Nmm5qslah8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
