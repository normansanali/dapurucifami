The rest… they just have to stay average.</p><p>That’s what poor Lake Champlain learned when its Great Lake status was ripped away only 18 days after it had joined the “popular kid group” of America’s freshwater reservoirs.</p><p>Congress voted to make Champlain great in 1998 — despite the fact that the Vermont and New York lake is almost tiny when compared to the original greats.</p><p>It covers a measly 490 square miles. When compared to the 7,430 square miles covered by Lake Ontario — the smallest of the Greats — and the 31,700 square miles covered by the Greatest Lake, Lake Superior, Champlain looks like a backyard koi pond.</p><p>The whole thing began when Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy slipped a little sentence reclassifying the lake into a routine refunding bill for the nation’s sea-grant program.</p><p>The bill gave $290 million to research centers along the five lakes and the two oceans (there have always been just two oceans).</p><p>No one even noticed Leahy’s amendment until after the bill was passed.</p><p>President Bill Clinton signed it into law, probably thinking that it wouldn’t hurt anyone to give a well-liked Senator access to that funding.</p><p>“Without fanfare or even a routine announcement, President Clinton signed a bill today giving Lake Champlain official designation as one of the Great Lakes, at least far as Federal research money goes,” <a href=# rel=noopener>The New York Times</a> wrote on March 7, 1998.</p><p>As the news began to spread, people were displeased and shaken to find one of the icon’s of American topography suddenly changed.</p><p>“If Lake Champlain ends up as a Great Lake, I propose we rename it ‘Lake Plain Sham,'” said Ohio Representative Steven C. LaTourette.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-126793 alt="Lake Champlain" width=900 height=703 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/lake-champlain-old.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-126793 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>The New York Historical Socity/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Looks pretty Great to me.</span></p><p>A cartoon showed Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy — the bill’s author — pointing to a lake labeled “the SIXTH Great Lake.” Mr. Leahy was labeled “the FOURTH Stooge.”</p><p>Leahy was dismayed that his simple move for more research funds had “snowballed into concerns that we would have to rewrite our encyclopedias or throw out our atlases.”</p><p>He called a meeting and a solution was quickly reached. Champlain would be a “cousin” to the Great Lakes, and — as such — it would be eligible for the same funding resources.</p><p>It is a pretty lake though, and it shouldn’t just be the “career lakes” that get all the glory.</p><p>I, for one, propose we Make Champlain Great Again.</p><p>Next, read about the <a href=#>bizarre Indian lake where skeletons wash ashore</a>.
