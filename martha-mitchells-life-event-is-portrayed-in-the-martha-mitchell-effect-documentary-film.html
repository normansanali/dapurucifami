The documentary will premiere exclusively on Netflix on June 17 (Friday), 2022.&nbsp;The documentary’s co-directors are Debra McClutchy and Anne Alvergue, and its producers are Beth Levison and Judith Mizrachy. The Netflix documentary was executive produced by Jamie Wolf, with Nathalie Seaver serving as co-executive producer.</p><p>According to reports, the new documentary will use previously unseen videos of Martha Mitchell, John Mitchell, H.R. Haldeman, Richard Nixon, and Helen Thomas to highlight the life and extraordinary effect of the ever-candid Mitchell. According to the official summary for the documentary The Martha Mitchell Effect:</p><p>“She was once as well-known as Jackie O. Then she attempted to assassinate a President. The Martha Mitchell Effect is an archival documentary picture of an unlikely whistleblower: Martha Mitchell, a Republican cabinet wife who was gaslighted by the Nixon Administration in order to keep her silent. It provides a feminine perspective on Watergate via the woman’s own words.”</p><p>Viewers have been eager to see the fascinating and absorbing life story of Martha Mitchell develop since Netflix released the documentary film’s debut teaser on May 23, 2022. Without further ado, let’s get to know the outspoken Martha Mitchell ahead of the documentary’s Netflix launch.</p><h2>What was Martha Mitchell’s involvement in the Watergate scandal?</h2><p>Martha Elizabeth Beall Mitchell (1918 – 1976), also known as Martha Mitchell, was John N.
