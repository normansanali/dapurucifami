This doesn’t mean that the earrings are plain, though - in fact, they look very modern thanks to the bar design that connects the chain from front to back. Bar earrings are one of the newer earring designs, and when paired with chains, it gives the earrings more volume and composition while retaining that signature minimalist look.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The earrings are made with 925 Sterling Silver and are completely nickel-free. The bars measure 10mm each, and the entire thing is around 31mm in length. Since the design is so simple, you can wear it with almost anything, and you can even get away with wearing them at formal outings due to how elegant and chic they look despite lacking any gem or stone.</span></p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Check On Amazon</a><h3 class=review-product__title><a href=# rel=nofollow>Reffeer Earrings</a> <span class=review-product__title-badge>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Hoop Style</span></h3><a href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/reffeer-hollywoodlife.jpg></a><h4 class=review-product__features-title>Key Features</h4><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Hoop earrings</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Two chains with different lengths</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>925 Sterling silver</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>1.5g weight</span></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Another type of earring that’s more commonly associated with modern fashion is hoop earrings. As the name suggests, hoop earrings have an element that loops around your ear in a hoop-like fashion. These earrings look great when worn, as the chains flow down elegantly around and below the hoop. Like many other earrings on this list, these are made out of 925 Sterling silver.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The earrings weigh a total of 1.5g and are 22mm long making them a bit smaller than other earrings, but the double-length chain really adds to the complexity of the look. The earrings come in a nice white box package, so if you want to gift someone these earrings, you can do so immediately. There’s even a full refund policy to take advantage of if you aren’t satisfied with the product when it arrives.</span></p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Check On Amazon</a><h3 class=review-product__title><a href=# rel=nofollow>Dtja Earrings</a> <span class=review-product__title-badge>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Best Bang for Your Buck</span></h3><a href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dtja-hollywoodlife.jpg></a><h4 class=review-product__features-title>Key Features</h4><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Comes in black and silver colors</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Hoop earrings</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Set of 2 pcs.</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>925 Sterling silver</span></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>These next earrings are a slightly cheaper alternative to the previous one. If you’d rather save a bit of money, then you’ll like these earrings. The two earrings share very similar designs, and you can pick and choose either one at your own leisure. These particular earrings come in two different styles, black, and silver, making them a better choice for those who want to go for a more punk-like look. The earrings are, of course, made out of 925 Sterling silver.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They can be worn either on your lower ear lobe or even on the side, thanks to the hooped design. Wearing it on the side will allow the chains to hang nicely beside your ear, which looks really great for that punk vibe. The earrings also have a 60-day money-back guarantee if you ever feel the need to get a refund; just be sure to contact them within that time period.</span></p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Check On Amazon</a><h3 class=review-product__title><a href=# rel=nofollow>SLUYNZ Earrings</a> <span class=review-product__title-badge>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Cuff Style</span></h3><a href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/sluynz-hollywoodlife.jpg></a><h4 class=review-product__features-title>Key Features</h4><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Removable cuff</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Chain connected on one end</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>11.5cm long</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Fast shipping</span></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>At first glance, these earrings may look similar to the two previous ones, but they’re actually quite different. The chain of the earrings does not connect on both ends, with the other end falling down freely. These earrings are made to hang below your ear lobe and cuff the side or top of your ear. You can see a great example of how to wear these earrings on their store page, and the resulting look is both unique and elegant.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>If you’re worried about having to get more than one ear piercing, don’t worry: the cuff can easily be put on and taken off without piercing. The chain, however, does need to loop through your lower ear, so keep that in mind. The earrings resemble that of crawler earrings, which run along the side of your ear, but in a much looser fashion, since the chain isn’t actually connected to the sides of your ear but rather follows a similar shape.</span></p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Check On Amazon</a><h3 class=review-product__title><a href=# rel=nofollow>Benevolence LA Earrings</a> <span class=review-product__title-badge>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Simplest Style</span></h3><a href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/benevolence-hollywoodlife.jpg></a><h4 class=review-product__features-title>Key Features</h4><ul><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>14K dipped gold</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Simple</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Versatile</span></li><li style=font-weight:400><span style=font-weight:400>Nickel-free</span></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>If you like having precious metals in your earrings, then you’re going to love these. These gold chain earrings are made with 14K dipped gold, giving them a beautiful and lustrous finish. The earrings are hypoallergenic, so you don’t need to worry about getting any allergic reactions while wearing them. The posts of the earrings are also completely nickel-free and even comply with U.S. standards. While you can choose 14K gold for your earrings, you can also have them in white gold if you prefer that instead.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The earrings are very versatile, as they’re basically just a long chain. You can loop them around your piercings any way you wish, and if you’re creative enough, you can make a look that’s uniquely you. Of course, this versatility and creativity also come with a lack of actual identity, so if you don’t know how to wear these chains, it can be difficult to make them work. If you’re confident in your earring-wearing skills, though, these earrings will reward your fashion sense.</span></p><a href=# rel=nofollow>Check On Amazon</a><h2 class=review-bottom__title>Buyer's Guide: Find the Perfect Chain Earrings</h2><p><span style=font-weight:400>Don’t be chained down by gemstone earrings; expand your jewelry collection! Learn more about finding the perfect pair of chain earrings in this short guide.</span></p><h3>What Are Chain Earrings?</h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chain earrings are earrings that feature at least one chain on them. The chain can either serve as an accessory to the earring itself or as the entire earring in some situations.</span></p><h3>Why Should You Wear Chain Earrings?</h3><h4><i><span style=font-weight:400>They’re simple</span></i></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>Sometimes simplicity is best. You don’t need to be extravagant when going to the grocery store or picking up your laundry. And even if you want to look good, you may not like wearing something that’s a little too flashy for your tastes. Unfortunately, gem and gemstone earrings can garner a lot of attention, and it can be difficult to not stand out with them.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And that’s where chain earrings come in. While not as flashy as gemstone earrings, they still look great to wear, and people will still appreciate their beauty. With chain earrings, you’ll still somewhat stand out compared to wearing a pair of plain studs but not nearly as much as with other earring types.</span></p><h4><i><span style=font-weight:400>They’re versatile</span></i></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>One of the great things about chain earrings is that they’re versatile in more ways than one. For one thing, chain earrings are, by design, very minimal, meaning that you aren’t pigeonholed into going for a certain style every time you wear them. Instead, you can dictate what you want to wear, as the earrings will, at the very least, look decent with most outfits.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Aside from its minimal design, the chains themselves can be strung and worn in various ways. Chains can easily be looped around or simply hung down from your ear in any way you wish, and you can really get creative with how you put them on. Of course, these apply to open chains, as closed chains that have both ends connected to a loop or cuff can’t really be adjusted as easily.</span></p><h4><i><span style=font-weight:400>They’re affordable</span></i></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>This is arguably the main reason some people choose to go for chain earrings. Even though jewelry has become more accessible to the masses in this day and age, it can still end up being quite expensive. As such, cheaper alternatives also exist to appeal to those with tighter budgets. Chain earrings just so happen to fit the bill, as not only are they made out of affordable materials, but they’re also easy to manufacture. These factors make chain earrings very budget-friendly, and you won’t even have to spend over $50 in many cases.</span></p><h3>Things to Consider When Buying Chain Earrings</h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Keep these tips in mind when thinking about buying chain earrings.</span></p><h4><i><span style=font-weight:400>Chain types</span></i></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>There are three types of chain earrings and they differ based on the way the chain is connected to the frame. Firstly, you have closed chain earrings; these earrings have both ends of the chain connected to a frame, cuff, or hoop. They provide virtually zero customizability and creativity (unless the chains are detachable), but they’re also very easy to wear. You can put them on in less than a minute and be good to go.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Then, there are the open-chain earrings. These earrings have an open chain that is only connected to the frame on one end, while the other end hangs down freely. Of course, you can arrange the chain any way you wish, and this is the main advantage of open-chain earrings. The only issue is that it’ll take much longer to put on since you have to be a little more careful with setting up the chain.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Finally, there are the frameless chain earrings. Frameless chain earrings have no frame or hoop to connect to and are basically just a small chain that you wear around your ear. You’ll need at least two ear piercings to make these types of earrings work, which means not everyone can pull them off effectively.</span></p><h4><i><span style=font-weight:400>Chain length</span></i></h4><p><span style=font-weight:400>The length of the chain determines how long the earring will look on your ear, and in the case of open chains, also determines how much chain you’re able to work with. For closed chain earrings, you only really need to worry about how long the chain loop will look on your ear - simply pick a length that you think fits and you’re good to go.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For frameless and open-chain earrings, however, you’ll need to consider the chain length a bit more. With a short chain, you won’t be able to loop it around much, but with long chains, you’ll need more piercings to loop the chain around without it looking like it’s just hanging there. This can be difficult to nail the first time, so don’t worry if the chain feels a bit too long or too short when you first try to wear it.</span></p><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>Are chain earrings safe to wear?<p><span style=font-weight:400>As long as the earrings comply with U.S. standards and are hypoallergenic, they should be safe to wear.</span></p>Are chain earrings expensive?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Since chain earrings often do not have any gem or gemstone attached, they usually cost far less than the average earring.</span></p>Are chain earrings modern?<p><span style=font-weight:400>Chain earrings definitely have a modern air to them thanks to their minimal design.</span></p><img width=64 height=64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HL_social.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# title="Posts by HollywoodLife Reviews" class="author url fn" rel=author>HollywoodLife Reviews</a> HollywoodLife For over a decade Hollywood Life has been a leading source of celebrity, entertainment, and pop culture news.
