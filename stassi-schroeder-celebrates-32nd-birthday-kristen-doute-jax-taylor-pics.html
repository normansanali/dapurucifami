The blonde beauty showed off her small baby bump while wearing a sleeveless white sun dress and tan platform sandals during the outing and was joined by Beau, who wore a casual black T-shirt and jeans. Former Vanderpump Rules co-stars <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kristen Doute</strong></a>, 37, who, like Stassi, was fired from the Bravo series for racist behavior two weeks ago, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jax Taylor</strong></a>, 40, were also spotted going into the same home with flowers and gifts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/pregnant-stassi-schroeder-celebrates-32nd-birthday-backgrid-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Jax appeared to go solo since his wife <strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong>, 31, is most likely still in Kentucky to be with her mom, Sherri, who was just released from the ICU after suffering complications from bladder surgery.
