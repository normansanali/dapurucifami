Developed by CD Projekt Red, it prides itself on a massive amount of content like the developer’s previous projects. It includes a plethora of customization, such as weapons and clothing, vehicles, and large amounts of side quests, along with its main storyline.</p><p>One of these side quests is the long-running Epistrophy quest, where you have to get back a number of cars for the Delamain AI.</p><p>Delamain is an Artificial Intelligence that runs the taxi company known as the Delamain Corporation. During the second act of Cyberpunk 2077, an automated Delamain cab runs into your car, destroying it. While trying to fix your car, you learn about these rogue taxis and are sent on a quest by the AI to reestablish the connections of the cabs to the Delamain mainframe.</p><p>There are a total of <strong>7 </strong>of these cabs, and getting them back can range from easy to hard. Below is a list of each of these cabs and where you can find them.</p><h2 id=epistrophy-wellsprings class="rb-heading-index-0 wp-block-heading">Epistrophy: Wellsprings</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Epistrophy-Welsprings-edited.png><p>The Wellsprings cab can be found near Megabuilding. This rogue AI is very aggressive and will try to run you over. To return it, you will have to damage it, which you can do by using your own car or shooting it.</p><h2 id=epistrophy-badlands class="rb-heading-index-1 wp-block-heading">Epistrophy: Badlands</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Epistrophy-Badlands-edited.png><p>To find this Delamain Cab, go into the junkyard in the search area. You’ll find it under some wreckage and will need to get to it on foot. Get in the back and listen to it talk. It will tell you when you can reestablish the connection.</p><h2 id=epistrophy-the-glen class="rb-heading-index-2 wp-block-heading">Epistrophy: The Glen</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Epistrophy-The-Glen.png><p>The easiest cab to return. You’ll find it on the edge of an incomplete overpass, facing the direction of a stadium. It is contemplating driving off the edge, and you will have to convince it not to.</p><h2 id=epistrophy-north-oak class="rb-heading-index-3 wp-block-heading">Epistrophy: North Oak</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Epistrophy-North-Oak-edited.png><p>You’ll find this cab driving around in a circle. Follow it and scan it to listen to its story. After that, you will have to drive it back to the Delamain garage.</p><h2 id=epistrophy-rancho-coronado class="rb-heading-index-4 wp-block-heading">Epistrophy: Rancho Coronado</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Epistrophy-Rancho-Coronado-edited.png><p>When you make contact with this cab, it will start driving around the area in fear. To calm it down and send it back, you will have to destroy eight lawn flamingoes in the area.</p><h2 id=epistrophy-coastview class="rb-heading-index-5 wp-block-heading">Epistrophy: Coastview</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Epistrophy-Coastview-edited.png><p>When you make contact with this cab, it will lead you around and make some references that fans of the Portal series might enjoy. Eventually, it will lead you to an ambush against some gang members. After you take out these enemies, the cab will insult you some more before yielding and driving back to the Delamain HQ.</p><h2 id=epistrophy-northside class="rb-heading-index-6 wp-block-heading">Epistrophy: Northside</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gameriv.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Epistrophy-Northside.png><p>Once you head to the waypoint, the Delamain AI will inform you that he does not know the exact location of the cab. The cab is hidden, and you will have to search for it. Head west of the Longshore North fast travel location.</p><p>You’ll find a gray and orange warehouse with a parking lot. On both sides of the building is a set of small buildings. You’ll find the cab between the buildings to the right of the warehouse and the warehouse itself. Once you get near, the cab will start driving erratically. Follow it until it crashes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifkaKys7XVZ5qopV%2BYxqOx0amsp6NdZ314g4yao6VllJq5ornAoqVmm5GXeq27wpqroqeeqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
