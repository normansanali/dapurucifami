Brown explained to <a href=#>Country Now</a> that "It's saying that your girl, your wife, is your everything. You know that she don't walk on water or anything like that, but you basically praise her." He also revealed that because of daughter Kingsley, the song's meaning changed a bit. He added, "Originally it was thinking about Kate you know, but then I did this video that I put on my Instagram, it was me, Kate and Kingsley and I was singing it to Kingsley. So I was like you know, this song could be about my daughter."</p><p dir=ltr>When Brown sings the lyrics, "Now I ain't saying you can walk on water or that you can turn it into wine. But, girl, it feels like a miracle that you're mine," he clarified that he's really singing to his two special girls, <a href=#>Katelyn Jae</a> and Kingsley. "It's basically just <a href=#>worshiping my family</a> now, they're both my girls and I'd do anything for them. Worship the ground they walk on."</p><p dir=ltr>Brown, of course, noted that the heartfelt song could take on different meanings for others adding, "I feel like it's going to be a wedding song." Whether you hear "Worship You" as a romantic song, or as how you feel about your family, it's about praising your love!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWppZYN2e9OhnGaqlZa5brnEmqWippdir6a0yKebZqORo7JurtGorqerXay8s7%2FHoqdmsZ%2BqfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
