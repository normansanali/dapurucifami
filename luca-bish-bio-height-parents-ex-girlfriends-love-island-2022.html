He hoped he’ll be as successful as former Love Island couples on the show, saying: “When you actually look back at Love Island, you can see how many couples it’s genuinely made. I don’t know how many kids Love Island has made but there are a few, aren’t there?”</p><p>“I was enjoying being in a relationship, there were just things I didn’t like and we drifted apart,” Luca said. He added that he preferred to meet potential partners when he was out and about in Love Island 2022.</p><p>“I think when you go looking for it, it’s not as easy though, it’s like you’re too desperate for it,” Luca said. “If I think you’re the one or I like you, I’ll take you out on a date but other than that, if we talk and I don’t like where it’s going – then I won’t be throwing out dates”.</p><p>In the show, Luca’s tattoos have already become a topic of conversation amongst fans.</p><p>Luca was coupled with Paige Thorne, a paramedic from Swansea.

Viewers compared the tattoos to pop star Harry Styles. He explained, “My ex was a tattoo artist so I was a bit like her coloring-in book. I was going, ‘Go on then”. “But yeah, it’s probably the best thing I’ll ever get compared to Harry Styles at. They’re just very random. I wouldn’t say there’s a lot of meaning for a lot of them but they’re there now”.</p><p>That person was probably his last girlfriend who he dated for 4 years.</p><p>Luca also dated Strictly Come Dancing star and YouTuber Saffron Barker before stepping into the villa. He told Metro.co.uk, that he and Saffron dated for a few months around six months to a year ago, explaining that they initially met through friends. “We used to go to the same school in Brighton,” he said, recollecting how on one occasion, they went out as a group – and he and Saffron were both singles at the time.</p><p>“I think she had just come out of a relationship. And then yeah, that was it. We just kind of hit the ground running a bit. We still remain really good mates,” Luca said. The pair reportedly spoke last almost a month or two before. Saffron has “a very busy lifestyle” and his work as a fishmonger meant that he often works at night when asked why their relationship didn’t work out.</p><p>Luca dished, “I see her as a good friend”.</p><p>Moreover, he also revealed that since he was 16, he has never gone longer than 10 weeks without se*. Luca told how he would happily back out of doing the show if it meant he could date former contestant Maura Higgins.</p><p>Luca told, “Maura! If she likes a younger boy, I’ll sack this off right now! Everything about her – the face, the fieriness, the Irish accent. She’s got it all”.</p><h3><strong>Who Is Luca Bish Dating Today?</strong></h3><p>Based on the social media post, Luca Bish is single today.

Luca said, “I don’t like [my left] arm. This has got a lion on so people are comparing me to Harry Styles – I think nine times out of 10 people with tattoos have got a bloody lion on.”</p><p>Luca continued: “[My right] arm I like a bit more. It’s got Einstein, Amy Winehouse, Muhammad Ali, and Winston Churchill. There’s a bit more meaning there but all the others I’m a bit of a coloring-in book”.</p><p>“This year, for the first year ever, we want you guys at home to play Cupid and you will have your say on which boy couples up with which girl,” Luca said on Lorraine on Friday.</p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Luca Bish Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Luca Bish’s birthday is yet to reveal.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Luca Bish From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Luca Bish is originally from <span class=nc684nl6>Brighton and Hove.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifn6jAqrzNnq%2BtnJ%2Bkv2%2BvzqZmpa2TlnqjtdKhZJuhn2K1prXGoatmqJGnsq%2FA0macsWWXnr%2BtstGinKeco2K5sMLEZqCspJGjsW5%2Bj2tpaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
