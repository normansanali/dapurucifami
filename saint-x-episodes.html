Her sister, Claire, is still attempting to figure out what happened to Alison in the present. The inquiry is examined in a third timeline, which centres on the main suspect, Clive Richardson, whose life has been completely upended by the allegations.</p><p>“The series, which is told through multiple timelines, explores and upends the girl-gone-missing genre as it explores how a young woman’s mysterious death during a dreamy Caribbean vacation creates a traumatic ripple effect that eventually pulls her surviving sister into a dangerous pursuit of the truth,” according to the official synopsis.</p><h3>Saint X is a Limited Series<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/maxresdefault-11-1.jpg alt="saint x book ending explained,saint x who killed alison,saint x true story,saint x rotten tomatoes,saint x trailer,saint x netflix,saint x plot,saint x filming locations,saint x cast,saint x season 2,saint x episodes,st x phone number" width=1280 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></h3><p>There won’t be a second season of Saint X because Hulu has designated it as a limited series.
