In a series of screenshots posted to his Instagram Story in January 2021, Andrew shared messages between him and Amira, which shows her taking "full responsibility" for even deciding to go to Mexico in the first place. He then seemed to attack Amira, saying he's a "real one" and that she is a "fame hungry liar." He added, "All I ever did was support someone else's dream!! My presence on your screen is even further proof of that. I honestly never needed or wanted <a href=#>this show</a>."</p><p dir=ltr>By Feb. 3, Amira seemingly hinted at her relationship status, alluding that she was cooking for a special someone. "One of my fav things about being in a relationship is to share and cook for my partner," <a href=#>she wrote</a> on a since-deleted Instagram Story over a Boomerang of brownies.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>If the brownies Amira shared are in fact for a special someone, it's not clear whether they are for Andrew or someone new. <a href=#>Screen Rant</a> speculates that the couple may have chosen Serbia as the next destination for their loophole, which means they could very well be in America together if the plan worked out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGpmaX13e5hpZJ2ZqWKzqq3NnJxmmZ2ev6J5ya6qrWWTpLuntdGmnJ1lmJq%2Fbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2aqrZmkqsBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
