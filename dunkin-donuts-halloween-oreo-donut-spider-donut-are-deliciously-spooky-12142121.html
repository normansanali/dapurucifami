But if you think about it, pumpkin spiced coffee is on the more sophisticated end of sweet treats. Sometimes you don't want something multilayered and gourmet-tasting, you want something that will inspire memories from your childhood. What could possibly do that more than a donut covered in cookies?! Step aside all things pumpkin, the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Halloween Oreo Donut at Dunkin' </a>is going to give you a run for your dessert money.</p><p>Dunkin' Donuts' newest sugary creation is like a seven year-old's fever dream. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Per Chewboom,</a> the Halloween Oreo Donut is "a yeast shell donut filled with vanilla buttercream, topped with chocolate icing and Oreo cookie crumbles and drizzled with a Halloween-themed dark orange icing." Basically, it's a chocolatey, vanilla, butter-creamy, Oreo-covered monster that is also orange. The orange drizzle atop the crumbles Oreos gives the final product a fuzzy, monstrous external appearance worthy of the holiday it is celebrating.</p><p>But it is not the only Halloween donut Dunkin' is bringing to shelves. Making its long-awaited return to Dunkin' Donuts locations nationwide is the seasonal Spider Donut, which is not one, but TWO donuts in one. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Chewboom describes</a> the downright adorable treat as "a classic Dunkin’ donut frosted with orange icing along with an eight-legged donut creature nested on top, made from a glazed chocolate Munchkins donut hole treat with chocolate drizzle for the spider legs and orange drizzle for the eyes."</p><p>If you're plugged into Halloween treat news, you might have picked up on a theme Dunkin' seems to be keeping with. In addition to the donuts, Dunkin' is also offering Oreo Hot Chocolate for a limited time. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Foodbeast reports </a>the chain first dropped Oreo hot Chocolate as a member of its extensive line of hot beverages in 2016. It is said to embody the taste of cookies and cream, so likely a rick chocolate balanced by a subtle hint of vanilla creme.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Dunkin Donuts</p></figure><p>Speaking of Cookies and Cream, another Dunkin' brand, Baskin-Robbins, is also getting in on the spooky spirit by embracing Oreos. A festive take on the shop's classic favorite Cookies N' Cream called <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Trick Oreo Treat ice cream</a> will return to scoop shops during the month of October as the flavor of the month.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Baskin-Robbins</p></figure><p><a href=# class=T3D>Baskin-Robbins' Trick Oreo Treat</a> ice cream isn't just filled with orange Oreos (though, admittedly, that in itself would be enough to sell the stuff). Crumbled pieces of orange creme-filled Oreo cookies, and Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy pieces fill a vanilla ice cream base to create the flavor. Baby Ruth bars are comprised of peanuts, caramel, and chocolate-flavored nougat; Butterfinger bars are filled with a peanut butter crisp. When mixed together with crumbled orange Oreos, the resulting Trick Oreo Treat ice cream is a menagerie of all your favorite sweet treats. It is like all the best parts of your Trick-or -Treat haul but mixed in ice cream.</p><p>Dunkin' Brands, who is behind everything Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins releases, clearly wants you to rethink what makes your holiday sweet. Who wants fun-sized candy when you could have Oreo cookies in your morning donut AND your dessert? Sounds like more a treat than a trick.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC8jp2sp6OZo3qlu82uq6xlmJa5rbvWnpynZZ%2BnsrB5w6ilrqxdqL2qsMSrZJ2nnqrBbq3RnmSdnZyesKq71KyjsmWjpbywt9hmaGtpZGd%2Bc30%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
