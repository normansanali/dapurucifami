This time, though, Cameron is really gonna make it happen — he’s not playing around! He’s spent much of the last decade teasing us about the upcoming installments, throwing out piecemeal updates (with occasional breaks for a Titanic rerelease or to <a href=#>shade Alien: Covenant</a>). But this time, he’s serious. Avatar 2 is just the first of the <a href=#>installments known as the The Avatar Sequels</a>, which will come with a budget of $1 billion. (That’s three and a half Lord of the Rings trilogies, six Wonder Womans, 66 Hurt Lockers, and 250 Moonlights.) Below, a timeline of all Cameron’s Avatar promises that once seemed broken, or at least teetering on the edge of breaking, but he’s definitely about to make good on them, you’ll see. You’ll all see.</p><span class=divider-border></span><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj83f5dvl00033k5uuhq1h2sv@published data-word-count=30><strong>January 7, 2010: </strong>Days after Avatar <a href=#>made $1 billion</a>, Cameron announces that we’re getting a sequel. “Yes, there’ll be another,” he <a href=#>tells the crowd</a> after a screening in Los Angeles.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj83f5e1j00043k5uykhe88md@published data-word-count=68><strong>January 14, 2010: </strong>Now he says there won’t just be another — there will be several more. “I’ve had a story line in mind from the start — there are even scenes in Avatar that I kept in because they lead to the sequel,” he <a href=#>tells EW</a>. “It just makes sense to think of it as a two or three film arc, in terms of the business plan.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj83f5e1k00053k5u57g276n8@published data-word-count=48><strong>February 16, 2010: </strong>We’re not only getting several more trips to Pandora, but <a href=#>a book</a>! “I told myself, if it made money, I’d write a book.

I’m making Avatar 2, Avatar 3, maybe Avatar 4, and I’m not going to produce other people’s movies for them,” he tells <a href=#>the New York Times</a>.

As cities around the globe were shutting down to contain the virus, Avatar producer Jon Landau <a href=#>told the&nbsp;New Zealand Herald</a> that production was temporarily suspended: “We’ve delayed it. We had plans to come down Friday night with a group of people and start back up and we made the decision to hold off and continue working here [Los Angeles], and come down there a little bit later than we’d planned.” Weta Digital would continue to work on the movie’s digital effects during the pause in production.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ckaieck0b000u3h66q85shgfw@published data-word-count=48><strong>April 2, 2020: </strong><a href=#>Other directors and other movies</a> are falling victim to the global shutdown, with release plans and opening days shifting on the calendar.

So it’s all on hold right now.” Speaking from his Malibu home, the filmmaker explained that he was about to travel halfway across the globe for a phase of the shoot before lockdown put paid to those plans. “We were about to shoot down in New Zealand, so that got pushed.

The director also teases a time jump, specifically on “page 35 of the script in movie 4.” “We jump as many years as we need to jump,” he adds cryptically. But time isn’t the only thing broadening throughout the Avatar sequels. “Each movie is going to introduce audiences to new clans, new cultures on Pandora,” Landau says. “Once we introduce a character, they stay a part of the ongoing evolution. We just add to it. So you can expect to see the Metkayina that you meet in this movie in subsequent movies. There are other clans that we’ll introduce in movie 3 that you’ll see in movie 4 and so on and so forth.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbxw12f2000w3b71axqitmah@published data-word-count=66><strong>December 17, 2022:</strong> Avatar 2 actor Edie Falco <a href=#>goes on The View</a> and says she thought the film had already come out and not done well since she hadn’t heard anything about its release after shooting the film four years back. “So I thought, It happens,” Falco said.

Cameron says that since Avatar: The Way of Water has <a href=#>crossed the $1.5 billion mark globally</a>, it all but confirms that the next movies will go forward as planned. “It looks like just with the momentum that the film has now that will easily pass our break even in the next few days, so it looks like I can’t wiggle out of this — I’m gonna have to do these other sequels,” Cameron says. “I know what I’m going to be doing the next six or seven years. The point is we’re going to be okay. I’m sure that we’ll have a discussion soon with with the top folks at Disney about the game plan going forward for&nbsp;Avatar 3.” He added that his team is currently in post-production on CG work for the next film. “We’ve begun a franchise at this point,” he portends. “We’ve begun a saga that can now play out over multiple films.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cliui4mtp00133b6yfh9chccq@published data-word-count=164><strong>June 13, 2023: </strong>The Avatar sequels are moving on back to span a decade of release dates, with the last one now scheduled to be released in 2031, by which time we assume the human race will have made it to real Pandora and the whole concept will be rendered meaningless. First up, Avatar 3 is moving to December 19, 2025, from December 20, 2024. Avatar 4 will then be released on December 21, 2029, instead of December 18, 2026, and Avatar 5 is going to be out December 19, 2031, rather than the originally intended December 22, 2028. “Each Avatar film is an exciting but epic undertaking that takes time to bring to the quality level we as filmmakers strive for and audiences have come to expect,” producer Jon Landau <a href=#>wrote on Twitter</a>. “The team is hard at work and can’t wait to bring audiences back to Pandora in December 2025.” And we can’t wait to drive our flying cars to get there.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cliujgih5000f3b6yea5zbcfy@published data-word-count=5>This post has been updated.</p><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cl2i1nqmb00003ln7kbjkhehv@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Praise Eywa, James Cameron Finally Debuted Footage from Avatar: The Way of Water</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjo0f3opv004wt8y6vg2z00yf@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>19 More Titles for More Avatar Sequels</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>All of the Avatar Sequel Announcements: A Timeline</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyiwsCtmKtlo5q%2BtrHLZpinpp%2Bqu6SxzJ6lratdqbauscuipZ5lmpa6pr%2BMnJimnaKku2%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
