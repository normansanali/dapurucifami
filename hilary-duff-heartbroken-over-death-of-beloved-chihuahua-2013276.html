My heart is broken,” she <a href=#>wrote</a> along with a photo of the Chihuahua she brought home nearly a decade ago. “Say a prayer for my little angel.”</p><p>Lola is no stranger to Duff’s 3 million-plus followers on the social media site. Long before the arrival of her son Luca, the star shared photos of the pup, which she has called <a href=#>“my first baby.”</a></p><p>The last few years have been difficult ones though for the pint-sized pooch. In late 2011, Duff was photographed outside her vet’s office crying and solicited good thoughts for her pet from her fans on Twitter. Soon after, she revealed the dog had <a href=#>undergone brain surgery</a> to help bring relief to seizures it had been suffering. Fluid was drained from Lola’s brain during the serious operation, but the four-legged dynamo <a href=#>recovered nicely</a>.</p><p>Prior to that, the dog was rushed to the emergency room with an eye infection. Duff detailed that medical crisis as well.</p><p>Lola, who was about 9, was younger than Duff’s other Chihuahua, Coco, who is 15 and “such a little fossil,” she has said. A true dog lover, Duff has at least two other pups: a terrier, Jak, and Bernese Mountain Dog, Dubois.</p><p>May they give her lots of licks and nuzzles to help her through this loss.</p><p><img decoding=async title="Duff with her puppy posse: Dubois, Lola, Jak, and Coco (Twitter)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.zenfs.com/en-US/blogs/omgcelebnews/11e61f04-ea22-4b60-b633-5023f4ee72b5_600_HilaryDuff_062613.jpg alt width=610 height=470 sizes="(max-width: 680px) calc(100vw - 6em), (max-width: 1000px) 80vw, 1000px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>More Celebrity Features on Yahoo!:</p><p><a href=#>Paula Deen on Today: Pick Up That Stone and Throw It at Me</a></p><p><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey Regains No. 1 Slot on Forbesís 2013 List of the Most Powerful Celebrities</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#>Halle Berry Comes Out Swinging Against Paparazzi for Terrorizing Her Daughter</a></p><p><a href=#>Follow omg! on Twitter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahoZyWv7p5w66dn2WYmq6zwMGrpqSdnmK8t7HRZpuemaSderCyjJucpaemmrFur8ein66ZmKqubn6Pamprb2Zk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
