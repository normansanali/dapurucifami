When she went to her first session with Dr. Now, she weighed in at over 750 pounds. She was at a point in her life where she couldn’t even walk without help. Like many cast members, she had a food addiction that led to her obesity. With all of her hard work on the show, fans want to know where she is now.</p><h3>Margaret Johnson’s Weight Loss Journey</h3><p>When Margaret Johnson realized that she needed to get the help of Dr. Now, she opened up to the cameras about why she had a food addiction. Her father was verbally abusive toward her as a child. This caused her to seek comfort in food. Margaret was at her wit’s end and knew that she had to make some changes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c40505aba9f102a34dda2121b98df934?s=250&r=g"><p>Margaret knew that Dr. Now could help her get through this tough time. She was ready and motivated to make health and diet changes to better herself and her life. Her end goal was to lose the weight that she needed to qualify for gastric bypass surgery. Basically, all Margaret wanted to do is finally be able to get out of bed on her own. They also noted that she needed to leave the care of her mother, Millie.</p><h3>Margaret And Millie’s Relationship</h3><p>When it came to Margaret Johnson’s relationship with her mother, Millie, things weren’t as they seemed. Millie had a tendency to baby her and give her everything she wanted. This could have been part of the reason that she ate so poorly. Millie was called out for how aggressively she spoke with her daughter. There were also viewers who felt that she was abusive toward her. Overall, it seemed as if the viewers did not care for Millie and wanted Margaret to get help so she could move out on her own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c40505aba9f102a34dda2121b98df934?s=250&r=g"><p>Now that it has been quite some time since Margaret began her weight loss journey, where is she now? According to The Sun, Margaret doesn’t have quite the online presence as a lot of the former cast members. She is still working on losing more weight and is still on her weight-loss journey. She did end up losing over 150 pounds while she was on the show, so her fans are hopeful that she has lost even more weight.</p><p>What do you think about Margaret Johnson’s story?
