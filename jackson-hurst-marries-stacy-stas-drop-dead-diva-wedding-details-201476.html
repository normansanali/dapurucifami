Stas wore a Monique Lhuillier gown and a handmade head piece by Janie Baltzer, with hair and makeup by 1011 Makeup. She was escorted by her father and was joined by her sisters as her maids of honors, who carried flowers by Krista Jon. Jackson and his groomsmen donned Vera Wang suits.</p><p>The newlyweds tearfully recited their own vows. After saying "I do," they walked down the aisle to Indiana Jones' "Raiders March." The theme of the wedding was an old New Orleans vibe with a storybook twist. Gather Events created a vintage-inspired French parasol installation over the cocktail reception, and painted old books with the table numbers.</p><p>"I've never been more excited for any other day in my life than I was for my wedding day," Jackson tells <strong>Us</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Us </strong>exclusively revealed</a> the couple's first engagement photos after the Lifetime star popped the question back in October 2013.
