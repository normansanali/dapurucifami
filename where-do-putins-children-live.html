Even more recently, he was stripped of many honors.</p><p>Despite the sanctions and heavy criticisms, Putin demonstrates no remorse for his actions. His actions have forced hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians from their homes — with many fleeing to neighboring countries to avoid losing their lives.</p><p>His actions have led many people to ask about his family and children’s safety at the expense of Ukrainians.</p><p>Well, we’ve got you some answers.</p><h2>Where do Putin’s children live?</h2><p>Vladimir Putin was married to Lyudmila Aleksandrovna Ocheretnaya. The couple married on July 28, 1983, and lived together in East Germany from 1985 to 1990.</p><p>However, their beautiful marriage hit the rocks in 2008. But the couple announced their divorce on June 6, 2013, with no reasons cited as the cause.</p><p>They have two daughters; <a href=#>Mariya Putina, 36, and Yekaterina Putina, 35</a>.</p><p>It has also been reported that Putin has multiple children, including twin sons, with his alleged girlfriend, <a href=#>Alina Kabaeva</a>, Olympic gold medalist.</p><p>Where are his children?</p><p>This question was partially answered by Ukrainian journalist <strong>Daria Kaleniuk</strong> during UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s recent press conference with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.</p><p>During the press conference, Kaleniuk challenged the British prime minister to do more and further claimed that Nato is too afraid of World War 3, and that is why it has failed to act.</p><p>“Ukrainian women and Ukrainian children are in deep fear because of bombs and missiles which are going from the sky,” she said. “Ukrainian people are desperately asking for the rights to protect our sky, we are asking for a no-fly zone.”</p><p>She then dropped the bombshell about where Putin’s children live.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ghanafuo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Putin-Son-300x169.jpg><p>According to Kaleniuk, <a href=# rel=noopener>Putin’s children live in Netherlands and Germany</a>, and the Russian President even has properties in Germany.</p><p>“You are talking about more sanctions Prime Minister but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned, he’s in London, his children are not in the bombardments, his children are there in London,” she said.</p><p>“Putin’s children are in Netherlands and Germany. His mansions (in Germany), were they all seized?” she revealed.</p><p>While this is a bit clear, <a href=#>Ghanafuo.com</a> can’t confirm the exact location where Putin’s children live in Netherlands and Germany.</p><p>However, a few checks show his daughters Mariya and Yekaterina lived in Voorschoten, a village in the Netherlands between 2013 and 2014. Also, checks show they are currently living in East Germany.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kxKmx0Z5knaddpcK1tc2sZJygmaGxs7HNZqOirpVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
