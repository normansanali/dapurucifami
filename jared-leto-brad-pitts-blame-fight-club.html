The rookie Project Mayhem recruit suffers some pretty nasty injuries in a scrap with Tyler Durden, and in a new interview, the Academy Award winner admitted that it was Pitt who inspired his peroxide look, with Leto originally planning to remain a platinum blonde.</p><p>“I remember bleaching my hair and my eyebrows white. We did one pass, and I think it was Brad Pitt, he said something about, ‘Billy Idol.’ he was like, ‘Blonder!’. So we went even whiter with it. I liked being on that set because I got to watch Brad. He’s incredibly loose, naturalistic, always does something very different take to take and that was interesting to see. Everyone on it just kind of felt like we were just getting into trouble and doing something that was potentially special but on the darker side of the universe.”</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/jared-leto-fight-club.jpg alt="jared leto fight club" width=1280 height=624 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>Fight Club may not have been a massive hit when it was released, earning just over $100 million at the box office on a $63 million budget, but it soon began to seep into the fabric of popular culture. It was one of the most controversial and talked-about films of 1999, and you could make the argument that it also became the first genuine cult classic of the 21st Century.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=false>The uncompromising takedown of capitalism and masculinity still boasts a huge following over 20 years on, something it didn’t manage to capture at the time.
