As much as she wants to identify the bomber and bring him to justice, I don’t think she’d just dive in and jeopardise the operation in such a dunderheaded way. If Quinn hadn’t have shot her at literally the very last moment, I don’t think she’d have had a chance. Franklin was so cold and calculating that he wouldn’t have thought twice about shooting her twice in the head. She was lucky to get away with a shot in the arm.</p><p data-characters=837 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=true>The fact that she’s pregnant, and had a check-up this episode, casts her shooting in a very different light. I’m guessing the shock of a gunshot combined with such a dramatic fall is enough to cause a miscarriage, so we’ll have to wait and see what happens. Carrie didn’t seem too enthusiastic about having the child at all – she pointedly didn’t want to know the sex, saying so in a deliberately nonchalant way – but it seems like her dedication to Brody might just be her only reason to keep the baby. It’s a sad irony that the only reason for keeping the baby might just be the very thing that kills the baby. How this story turns out will determine if Carrie is ultimately a tragic figure swallowed up by the machinations of international terrorism, like Ophelia drowning in the river.</p><p data-characters=443 data-current-count=443 data-injectable=true>And Brody. Brody Brody Brody. Just what the hell is Saul planning? Is he going to make Brody the interim president of Iran? He’s still strung out in the Tower of David, under the control of El Nino, and looking in a very bad way. Saul’s got nine days to pull off whatever he’s planning, and it seems like he gets bolder every episode. I don’t know about you but I can’t wait to see what happens next on&nbsp;<strong>Homeland</strong>!</p><p data-characters=21 data-current-count=21 data-injectable=false><strong>Random Robservations:</strong></p><ul data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true><li>When Franklin was dissolving the bomber’s body in acid, all I could think of was my Breaking Bad chemistry knowledge.
