If you haven‚Äôt seen The Total Package since his WCW and <a href=#>WWE</a> heyday, you may be wondering if it‚Äôs the same Lex Luger.</p><p>Lex, real name Lawrence Wendell Pfohl, is a two-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. He was voted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Most Popular Wrestler of the Year in 1993</a> while with WWF. However, he has been mostly absent from pro wrestling programming since WCW closed in 2001. He looked like almost every other healthy, 30-something wrestler in the early 2000s, but now he's in a wheelchair. Keep reading for all of the details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: A&E</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why is Lex Luger in a wheelchair?</h2><p>Lex nearly died in a motorcycle accident in 1992. Six months later he was back in a wrestling ring and made his WWF debut. This near-fatal accident isn't why Lex is currently in a wheelchair.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Lex talked about the experience that led to needing a wheelchair in an Oct. 21, 2009, piece on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWE.com</a>. "I injured my neck on an airplane from Atlanta to San Francisco," Lex explained about the flight that changed his life in 2007. "The way I had turned my neck while sitting on the plane had basically cut off my blood flow. It was just a freak accident, but it caused massive swelling from my C6 [vertebra], at the base of my neck, to my D5 in my chest. It paralyzed me from the neck down."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Oh what a night!!<br>Stinger went out in style!!<br>üòä‚ù§Ô∏è<br>‚Å¶<a href=#>@Sting</a>‚Å© <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/P94bwcFhbK</a></p>‚Äî Lex Luger (@GenuineLexLuger) <a href=#>March 4, 2024</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The Total Package has a new lease on life.</h2><p>While Lex may be unrecognizable if you only remember him as The Total Package, he‚Äôs still mentally sharp and appears in the occasional WWE video. There was even a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Biography: Legends</a> episode on Lex in 2022 on A&E/Peacock.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>In an Aug. 4, 2022, interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated</a>, Lex was asked about his current health status. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mind-boggling. I‚Äôm in phenomenal health,‚Äù Lex states. ‚ÄúOther than my mobility issues from my spinal cord issue, I‚Äôm very healthy, and that‚Äôs a miracle of God after what I put my body through. I usually use a wheelchair or a walker, but I can walk some."</p><p>"I have great mobility, I drive," Lex continued. "But you know how your power will go out for a moment during a storm? That can happen to me, and I‚Äôm on the floor before I know it. So I take a lot of precautions. I live totally independently, which wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen. I don‚Äôt look the same because I don‚Äôt hit the weights like I used to, but I‚Äôm healthy."</p><p>In an Oct. 30, 2023, episode of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Under The Ring: Pro Wrestling Conversations</a>, Lex gave an update on his day-to-day. "I was never supposed to be partially paralyzed," Lex says. "I‚Äôm what they call a ‚Äòhigh-functioning quadriplegic.‚Äô I can live independently and feed and bathe myself. I was not supposed to be able to do any of that. I can live independently. It‚Äôs really a miracle of God that I can do what I do.‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">If you're a fan of Psalm 118:24, you'll want to give Lex a follow.</h2><p>Lex is a born again Christian due to his friendship with the aforementioned Sting.
