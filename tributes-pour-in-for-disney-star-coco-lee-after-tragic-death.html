The global superstar, who is due to kick off the US leg of her huge Renaissance world tour in just a couple of days, was forced to pull the show in Pittsburgh due to logistics and scheduling issues. The show was due to take place on 3 August but will now not go ahead, fans have been told they will receive a refund at the point of purchase. It comes soon after Queen Bey also had to postpone her show in Seattle, once again due to scheduling conflicts and production logistics. However, it's not all bad because those heading to the Seattle show will only have to wait an extra day to see the Crazy in Love hitmaker hit the stage. Those heading to Kansas City, however, will have to wait a little longer because that show has been moved from September 18 to October 1. Beyonce's US tour kicks off in Toronto on 8 July.</p><p id=ev8FkRsH3- data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Daily Lowdown: Adele issues stark warning to fans at recent gig</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eqyw7khxo8 data-wc=13><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The Daily Lowdown: Taylor Swift has best reaction to on stage blunder</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e8294c9f1a1a-beyonce-renaissance-tour.jpg><p id=emJerSivhk data-wc=111>Speaking of touring, Taylor Swift has added more dates to the European leg of her Eras world tour and has subsequently ruled out an appearance at Glastonbury festival next year. Taking to social media, Taylor said she was added another date in Dublin, Ireland which will take place on the final weekend of June, ruling the Anti-Hero singer out as a potential headliner for the 2024 festival. Taylor also added more dates for shows in Liverpool, Edinburgh and London so fans now have a slightly better chance to see her take to the stage. The general sale of tickets for Taylor will start to be released in stages from 17 July.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/e75b488530a2-taylorswift-piano.jpg><p id=e3Xh8bVpGok data-wc=91>Congratulations to Miley Cyrus who is still reigning champion with her hit song Flowers after its remained the biggest song of the year so far.

Keke, who shares a six-month-old son with Darius, attended the singer's Las Vegas residency show where she was serenaded by the Yeah! Singer, but Darius was unhappy with her choice of outfit. Darius retweeted a video of Usher singing to Keke and said he wasn't a fan of her outfit, saying 'you are a mum', he then defended himself saying he has standards and morals for his family and their representation. Keke is yet to respond publicly about the comments.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/58f706dbda77-keke-palmer.jpg><p id=eXBaLNx9FlV data-wc=109>And tributes have been flooding in for Disney star and singer Coco Lee after she passed away aged 48.
