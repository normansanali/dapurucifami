Wearing an all-blue ensemble, little George waved at the excited crowd before entering the wing to meet his sibling. &nbsp;</p><p>“George was aware that he would soon have a new brother or sister and has been excited throughout the pregnancy,” a family friend tells Us. “He might have been a little shy around the new baby, but I heard everything went well. He’s great around other children. He’s a very curious boy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>The family brought home their newest bundle of joy to Kensington Palace and were promptly visited by a slew of guests, including <strong>Pippa, Carole</strong>, and<strong> Michael Middleton </strong>and <strong>Prince Charles, Camilla Parker Bowles</strong>, and<strong> Emilia Jardine-Paterson</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The Palace was inundated by flowers and gifts from around the world, many from members of the public and others from important figures and officials they have met over the years,” a source tells Us.</p><p>Little Charlotte’s grandfather <strong>Prince Charles</strong> is “over the moon about having a granddaughter. He’s a very proud man at the moment,” a source tells Us, adding, “He was convinced all along that it would be a girl.”</p><p>As for the second-time parents, a family friend tell Us they are “ready to take on the challenge” of raising two children, adding, “They are a lot more calm this time. I remember when George was brought back after he was born and they were so nervous. But the second time they feel relaxed and are able to take in and enjoy these first moments at home with the baby.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpmjsKZ5xp6mq5%2BVYsOmvthmnLGbmamypXnMnpytZaOewLWx0Wanq6GemLK0v4ycn5qqnKTBtbGMa2dqbWRqfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
