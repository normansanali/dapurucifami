The pair’s first meeting occurred in 2007, when the athlete asked his agent to reach out to Decker’s rep after he saw her in an issue of Sports Illustrated. He popped the question to his now-wife in 2008.</p><p>The couple <a href=#>welcomed their 3-year-old son, Hank</a>, in 2015 and <a href=#>19-month-old daughter, Stevie</a>, in 2018.</p><p>When it comes to diapering their children, Decker told Us in August 2018 that <a href=#>she takes the lead on this task</a>. At the time, she joked that Roddick “can’t ball up a diaper if his life depended on it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Andy-Roddick-and-Brooklyn-Decker-Keep-the-Romance-Alive.jpg><p>“The amount of times I’ve found open dirty diapers on the floor when I’m, like, ‘There is Velcro here to help you ball this diaper up and toss it,’” she told Us. “It’s really quite a weakness of his.”</p><p>Roddick, meanwhile, <a href=#>has improved his diapering skills</a>. “I’m pretty committed. I kind of dive right in there, and she’s very neat about it,” he explained. “I’m like, ‘Listen, it’s pass, fail. Let’s just get it, and get it in the little gross diaper bin thing.’”</p><p>With reporting by Marc Lupo</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappSuerO7w52gnKNdp7K3scClqmajla56tbuMpJyeqJmjtG6%2BzqaYp5uVYsSqwMdmmaunn6C5urqMnZyco5WnfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
