In fact, he recently married the love of his May Oyola in April 2022.</span></p><p><span>So, who is she? Keep reading this Oyola Bio to learn all about her.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><b>Meet May Oyola, Teen Mom 2 Star Nathan Griffith Wife</b></h3><p><span>It was May 2022 when Nathan Griffith first revealed that he married a woman named May Oyola v.i.a. a (now-deleted) FB post. Though the post was soon removed, fans were quick to screenshot it, and upon further research “Heavy.com” found that the pair exchanged vows back on April 15, 2022, in Miami-Dade County, Florida.</span></p><p><span>The news about May and Nathan’s wedding comes about 7 years after Nathan’s brief engagement to Janelle Evans in 2015. To viewers’ dismay, </span><i><span>Teen Mom 2</span></i><span> stars didn’t end up officially tying the knot.</span></p><p><span>Also, prior to the split, the couple looked the happiest. “I was completely shocked. I think I had an idea he would probably propose to me here, but I didn’t know when during the week he was going to do it. And I didn’t know what was going to happen or anything. So it was like expected, but unexpected,” Janelle back then shared her happiness after the engagement.</span></p><p><span>But Janelle was the only girl in Nathan’s life before he married May Oyola. Initially, he was married to Alison Stevens, the mother of his daughter Emory.</span></p><p><span>Then came Janelle, and after ending his courtship with her, Nathan briefly dated Jessica Henry and then Ashley Lanhardt for several years before splitting around the end of 2020.</span></p><p><span>Overall, Nathan has met over 5 lovers in his life, two of whom gave him a baby.</span></p><p><span>His kids are — Kaiser Griffith (from his relationship with Jenelle) and JeEmery Griffith (from his relationship with Allison).</span></p><p><span>Reportedly, though Nathan didn’t get along with Jenelle and her husband David Eason, he visited their home every other weekend to meet his son.</span></p><p><b>Fun Fact:</b><span> Nathan was still on Tinder not too long age before marrying May.</span></p><h3><b>May Oyola Age</b></h3><p><span>May Oyola was likely born after 1990. So, that would make her at least 32 years of age in 2022.</span></p><p><span>Likewise, her husband Nathan Griffith turned 34 years of age on September 19, 2021.</span></p><h3><b>May Oyola Job</b></h3><p><span>Many believed that May Oyola was a Design Release Engineer at </span><i><span>General Motors</span></i><span> and </span><a href=#><span>this</span></a><span> was her LinkedIn. However, we can confirm that the “May Oyola” on the given link isn’t the May we’re looking for, and surely her job isn’t engineering.</span></p><p><span>In case you want to know about the speculated May’s career, she is a P</span><i><span>enn State University</span></i><span> electrical engineering graduate who joined </span><i><span>General Motors</span></i><span> as an intern in May 2018 before officially starting her job as a “controls engineer” 4 months later.</span></p><p><span>Also, she’s worked as a team member at </span><i><span>Jamba Juice</span></i><span>, gift shop cashier at Minerals </span><i><span>Resort and Spa</span></i><span>, and sales associate at </span><i><span>Mountain Creek Resort</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>On the other hand, Nathan is a personal trainer who’s been contract freelancing for over 6 years. This </span><i><span>Athens High School</span></i><span> graduate initially started his career in July 2006 as a part of “Infantry 0311” at the </span><i><span>U.S. Marine Corps</span></i><span>. Retiring exactly 4 years later, Nathan then joined </span><i><span>Travel + Leisure Co.</span></i><span> as a “frontliner” and in 2016 he briefly became a running-back at </span><i><span>American Indoor Football Association</span></i><span>.</span></p><p><span>However, it wasn’t until Jan 2014 that Nathan stepped into the limelight as a reality star, all thanks to </span><i><span>Teen Mom 2</span></i><span>. He first appeared on the MTV documentary series on its ep 2 titled “Love Will Never Do Without You.”</span></p><p><span>At the time, Jenelle had just terminated her pregnancy and she finds emotional shelter in a new guy she had just stumbled upon, Nathan.</span></p><p><b>Did you know:</b><span> Nathan was charged with a misdemeanor and other minor ordinances, which was featured on </span><i><span>Teen Mom 2</span></i><span>. On the show, he was advised by his lawyers to accept a plea deal in order to dismiss a felony charge against him. Because of this, things also got pretty heated up between Nathan and Jenelle.</span></p><h3><b>Is May Oyola On Instagram?</b></h3><p><span>As of 2022, May Oyola had kept her Instagram private. However, reports had that she shared numerous selfies on it.</span></p><p><a href=#><span>This</span></a><span> might be her IG.</span></p><p><span>Also for those of you who’ve reached FB account @</span><a href=#><span>mayra.oyola.1</span></a><span>, that’s not May, at least not the one we’re looking for.</span></p><p><span>Find Nathan on FB @</span><a href=#><span>nathan.j.griffith.1</span></a><span>.
