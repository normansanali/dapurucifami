For his appearance on the red carpet at the FX and Vanity Fair Emmy celebration party, Fern wore a smokey eye consisting mostly of red eyeshadow, as seen above.</p><p>The makeup look is reminiscent of the one his character, Michael Langdon, wears in “American Horror Story: Apocalypse.” For the role, Fern wore a lot of red eye shadow, a decision made by both Fern and the show’s makeup artist, Eryn Krueger Mekash, per The Hollywood Reporter. “Now I’m seeing people doing that, and that’s really fun,” shared Mekash. “Cody and I had a great time coming up with that look, but seeing it on other people is so cool.”</p><p>Fern paired his dazzling eyeshadow look with a floral-patterned shirt with red blooms, matching his eye makeup. The star has been known to wow on the red carpet with both his fashion choices and accompanying makeup, as reported by Wonderland. He first caught attention for his unconventional choices at the Golden Globes in 2019, when he wore a partially sheer shirt and winged eyeliner. “I had been playing the game of wearing the suit with the nice tie and trying to fit in,” he told Wonderland. “So doing that at the Golden Globes? It was actually for me. It was like shedding that skin.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaerW1zJ5knKeUrnqnsdGnZKmtnKGypXnOn51mmV2ZrrvGy6KloGWVrrK0tMCdprBlnKS8rHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
