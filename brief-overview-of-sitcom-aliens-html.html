Actor Robin Williams and actress Pam Dawber shown in scenes from TV show.<p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-3dfab0c1cb7601624cf5c80f6bbb07c3-2-0-0@published data-word-count=159>Realism in comedy has been the trend for the last several years, thanks in part to the rise of the single-camera mockumentary format. But it’s not the only way to go. <i>The Neighbors</i>, which premieres tonight on ABC (read our critic’s review <a href=#>here</a>), attempts to buck the trend by setting itself in a posh cul-de-sac populated by aliens who disguise themselves as humans. It’s not the first show to use that format, though — aliens have been the stars of sitcoms for ages. Alien shows aren’t just about the weird quirks of their alien characters, though that’s definitely a substantial part of where their humor comes from. The point of an alien show is to identify and ridicule the strange, confusing, or hypocritical aspects of American culture; alien characters typically force their earthling companions to explain customs (especially kissing) and rituals, and these explanations force us to confront the innate absurdity of the human condition.
