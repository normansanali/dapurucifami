In March 2022, he confirmed he had accepted the role to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> while attending the premiere of The Batman. Jason said, "It's fun, I get to play the bad guy, which I haven't gotten to do for a while. Now, I get to be the bad boy. A very flamboyant bad boy. A little panache!"</p><p>Jason isn't the only superhero actor to join the Fast & Furious franchise.

In a heartfelt Instagram post and accompanying photo, Vin wrote, "Yeah yeah yeah… you see this angel over my shoulder cracking me up, you say to yourself, 'that’s Captain Marvel.'
