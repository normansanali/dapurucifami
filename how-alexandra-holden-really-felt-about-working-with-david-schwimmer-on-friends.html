That held true for some of the most establishes acts in Hollywood, especially for those that didn't have the experience of working in front of a live audience.</p><p>Throughout the history of guest stars and supporting characters, none of the main cast ever got bashed for having an ego. Instead, they received a lot of praise and that was especially true for David Schwimmer. <a href=#>The likes of Jane Sibbett praised Schwimmer for his talents on set.</a></p><p>"I saw David Schwimmer do the most incredible take,” she said. “I'd never seen anybody do comedy like that. He literally took the longest take with his comedy. I just thought, oh my goodness, I have to work with this man. He is brilliant.”</p><p>The same held true for Sibbett's partner on the show <a href=#>Jessica Hecht, who also had respect for Schwimmer</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I loved working with David,” she said. “He's really smart about bits.

At the start, there was a chemistry read for Holden. This is typically done to see how two actors are together, and if it works. Although it did in fact work as Holden got the role on the show, the circumstances were extra stressful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Holden, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was given an odd request by the producers prior to her audition</a>, which only made things that much more stressful for the young actress.</p><p>“I got called in to do a ‘chemistry read’ with David Schwimmer. It was terrifying because the producers told me to come in looking ‘as hot as possible’. I didn’t know what to do with that information. It sent me into a tailspin.”</p><p>This would lead to a sleepless night for the actress trying to figure out what to wear. “Stayed up all night trying to figure out what to wear. Now that I’m older, I wouldn’t be happy getting that message.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Christine Taylor Had Completely Different Experiences With Jerry Seinfeld And David Schwimmer On Their Respective Sitcoms</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nowadays, we assume this type of advice would not be given prior to an audition.

One of them involved David Schwimmer and his excitement for Bruce Willis' cameo on the show. Holden recalls, “The next day we showed up to work and I was in my dressing room and there was a bang bang bang on my door,” she explains. “I open it and there was David and he’s like, ‘Oh my God, did you hear?’ I thought there was a fire but he just yelled, ‘Bruce Willis!’ And then he went bounding down the hallway to tell everybody else.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for her chemistry with Schwimmer, the two meshed well together on-set. Holden also recalls a certain punchline being added at the last second, and killing it with the live audience.</p><p>“We had done a take for the audience and it was good, but then the writers came over to me,” says Holden. “They said, ‘This time when Ross says, ‘I was just thinking about your dad,’ say ‘Well whatever works for you.’ It totally killed because the audience wasn’t expecting it — it’s such a testament to the writers, how they could come up with new jokes on the fly.”</p><p>As for the negatives, Holden revealed that those behind the scenes encouraged her to change styles. Holden herself admits that her fashion sense wasn't all that great at the time. She was told to dress 'cuter'.</p><p>SOURCES - EW & Huffington Post</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dlrmmxMCnm6uZXZ28rbDEp2SrnZGhubp5xZ6jrWWRl7y2wIywpqujmaO0bsPIrZ9mnJGrtqV50pyfsKGdorKzec6nZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
