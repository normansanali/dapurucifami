I just don't feel like there's anything left to do, really. I miss the players within it. I miss the writing staff and Pam Fryman, who directed all of those shows. It was fun to get to play with the same actors every week, but right now I'm knee-deep in Snicket and those are some bony knees."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which ‘How I Met Your Mother’ Cast Member Has The Highest Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Neil took great pride in the show and in fact, he wasn't a fan of cameos, even if it was by someone as popular as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears</a>. He explained why.</p><h2 id=viewership-is-not-our-game>"Viewership Is Not Our Game"</h2><p>Ultimately, he didn't feel as though the show needed any cameos and on the contrary, he felt as though celebs making appearances would hurt the story. He also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't want to turn into a series like Will & Grace</a>, "I’m in the minority that our show does not need stunt casting in order to succeed.&nbsp;I worry that if they start ‘Will and Grace'-ing us too much, that the show will suffer. And we’re all really proud of the content of the show. I mean, viewership is not our game. It’s the network and the studio’s game, you know. It’s the promotion department’s game."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears & 9 Other Celebs We Forgot Were On 'How I Met Your Mother'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Going up against&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dancing with the Stars' was another big reason for Britney's much-needed cameo.

And if it was classic stunt casting, like, ‘Oh, my tour bus broke down outside’ and I just go, ‘Wow, Britney Spears, what are you doing here?’ then, like, we’re just flying over that shark real fast. It was a great character and I think she played it well. ... I’m glad that we didn’t sensationalize the character in any way.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED -<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Neil Patrick Harris Says This Was His Favorite 'HIMYM' Episode</a></span></p><p>As the Los Angeles Times noted, it was an excellent decision.
