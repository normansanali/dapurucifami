You can display marquee-style titles such as “Mr. & Mrs.” up on the wall.</span></p><h3><span>How to Select Marquee Letter Lights for an Event?</span></h3><p><span>You might forget what kind of food you had at someone’s wedding, birthday, or bridal shower, but you won’t forget the kind of décor and ambiance the whole event had. Here are some tips to follow when you’re selecting décor marquee lights for an event:</span></p><h4><span>Analyze and finalize</span></h4><p><span>The first step to prepare for an event is to carefully analyze the space you have and the sources of light already present in the spot. Pick the best spot in the space as the central, focal point. That’s where your marquee letters will go. It could be a stage, an entrance, an outdoor table, an intimate corner of the room, etc.</span></p><h4><span>Select the marquee light</span></h4><p><span>This decision will mainly be determined by the area and the event or vibe you’re decorating for. For instance, if you’re getting marquee lights for the entrance, you can go for a feather or grass backdrop and put neon marquee light letters against it. Neon stands out and leaves a good impression.</span></p><p><span>For a wedding stage, you can pick large metal marquee letters with some unique quotes. Remember to always keep it short, making long sentences out of marquee letters can simply overwhelm a space.</span></p><p><span>For bedrooms, offices, or casual spots, you can personalize the space with your name’s initials, your full name, your baby’s name, or a motto you like to see every day.</span></p><h3><span>DIY Metal Marquee Letters</span></h3><p><span>Here are some simple steps to create a metal marquee sign and letter all by yourself:</span></p><ul><li><span>Gather up all the tools and material you will need in one place. You’ll need dividers, drill or driver, hammers, metal rules, gloves, safety glasses, metal sheets, round top screws, masking tape and more.</span></li><li><span>Decide the font you want on the marquee letter and the accurate, final size you want it in. Make sure you choose a simple font that’s not too complex or curvy to transfer onto a sheet and shape. Go for a font with straight strokes.

You can also draw them on the metal sheet yourself by using a mechanical grid approach to size the letters up.</span></li><li><span>Next step is cutting the letterforms. Once you have transferred the letters onto the metal sheet, put it onto a work table and cut it. Make sure you’re taking all the necessary precautions when doing so. Such as wearing gloves and safety glasses, etc.</span></li><li><span>To have better access to interior cutouts or interior of the ampersand, cut relief holes with a hole saw or spade bit. Make the folds and bends to form a big letter.</span></li><li><span>If you’re cutting large-sized letters, it’s better to get a helper to have better control and straighter cuts.</span></li><li><span>Cut out holes for where you want the bulbs to go in a straight line on the letter.</span></li><li><span>For light sockets, you can use regular candelabra light sockets, porcelain light sockets, or lamp parts.</span></li><li><span>Lay the wiring and bulb sockets through and into the holes.</span></li></ul><h3><span>How to Clean and Maintain Your Metal Marquee Letter Lights?</span></h3><p><span>Here are a few tips to keep a metal letter marquee in shape for years:</span></p><ul><li><span>Since metal is prone to rust, you need to keep the marquee letters stored properly away from moisture.</span></li><li><span>Clean the dust and dirt off by laying them on a clean surface flat with a cloth or duster.</span></li><li><span>Prepare a cleaning solution by mixing dishwashing liquid or soap with warm water.</span></li><li><span>Use a soft cloth or brush, wet it in the solution, and gently scrub the dirty surface or stains, if any.</span></li><li><span>Use a damp cloth to wipe the surface clean.</span></li><li><span>Do not use a pressure hose on the metal marquee as it can damage the metal if not dried properly afterward.</span></li><li><span>Dry the metal marquee thoroughly with a dryer or simply air dry it.</span></li></ul><h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3><p><span>Marquee letter decoration is one of the most attractive and trendy ways to light up a space.
