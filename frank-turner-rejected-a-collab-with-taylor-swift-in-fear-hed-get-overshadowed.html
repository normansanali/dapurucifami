Although her career spans over a decade, she is doing better than ever nowadays. With the Eras Tour in full swing, Swift is making more than $13 million a night in ticket sales alone. She’s not only expected to deliver the highest-grossing tour in music history, but has also grown her net worth exponentially with the re-release of some of her old albums and the premiere of her Eras Tour movie.</p><p>Over the years, Taylor Swift has collaborated with numerous artists, including Ed Sheeran, the Jonas Brothers, Kendrick Lamar, Keith Urban, HAIM, Lana Del Rey, and most recently, Ice Spice. Despite her success, there have been many artists who’ve rejected collaborating with Swift. For instance, in 2015, a British musician declined to work with the pop singer because he didn’t want to be overshadowed by her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Taylor Swift Has Harsh Words For Hollywood Paparazzi (But New York Is Better)</a></span></p><h2 id=frank-turner-rejected-a-collab-with-taylor-swift-fearing-she-rsquo-d-overshadow-his-work>Frank Turner Rejected A Collab With Taylor Swift Fearing She’d Overshadow His Work</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar33669635.jpg><p>In 2015, British punk and folk singer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Frank Turner rejected the idea of having a collab with Taylor Swift</a> on his album, Positive Songs for Negative People. His label suggested bringing the ‘Shake It Off’ singer to the studio to record his song ‘Secret Key,’ which Turner wrote for primary school teacher Christa McAuliffe, who died in 1986 in the Space Shuffle Challenger disaster. "I wanted the end [of the song] to be sung by an American woman [pretending] to be Christa,” the singer revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, he didn’t like the producer’s suggestions for this song. "The record label [Polydor] were suggesting some of the more famous people that [producer Butch Walker] has worked with, like, f****** Taylor Swift,” he explained. “No contact was ever made but they were like, 'Let's ask Taylor'. I was like, 'That's a f****** rubbish idea'."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Taylor Swift Showcased Her Business Smarts After She Avoided A Major Deal Worth Millions With FTX</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, Turner decided to collaborate with Esma Patterson.</p><p>"She just wasn't right for the record. And @EsmePatterson is awesome. The end," he tweeted at the time. Later on, the musician explained that he had no bad blood towards Swift but he feared that she would have overshadowed him if they had worked together. "Nothing against Swift, but she'd totally overshadow what I'm doing," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-1975-rsquo-s-lead-vocalist-matt-healy-accused-taylor-swift-of-hiding-their-collab-for-midnights>The 1975’s Lead Vocalist, Matt Healy, Accused Taylor Swift of Hiding Their Collab for Midnights</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/matt-healy.jpg><p>The 1975’s vocalist Matt Healy and Taylor Swift have given fans plenty to talk about, starting from their rumored relationship earlier this year. Shortly after they were first spotted together, fans speculated that <a href=# rel=nofollow>Healy and Swift were just collaborating on some songs</a>. However, Healy quickly shot those rumors down. “I would love that! But unfortunately FAKE NEWS,” wrote in response to a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">tweet that claimed that The 1975 were going to collaborate in Swift’s Midnights album</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite claiming that it was fake news before, Healy has now revealed that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The 1975 did a collaboration with Taylor Swift that was never released</a>. The musician claims that they “did a bit of work” for the singer-songwriter’s album Midnights. "We actually worked on that, but then that version of it never came out," he added.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Matty Healy Calls Kanye West His "Hero" As Taylor Swift Hopes Fans Forget Their Relationship</a></span></p><p>The musician didn’t reveal the title of the song they worked on.

Shortly after its release, the album went on to top the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Moreover, it became Spotify's most-streamed album in a single day and sold over a million albums across the world in just its first week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=artists-are-lining-up-to-collab-with-taylor-swift-inlcuding-carlos-santana>Artists Are Lining Up To Collab With Taylor Swift, Inlcuding Carlos Santana</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar50158241.jpg><p>Frank Turner might have snubbed the opportunity to collaborate with Taylor Swift, but many other artists would kill to be able to work with this acclaimed singer. For instance, legendary guitarist <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Carlos Santana revealed that the ‘Blank Space’ singer is on his list of dream collaborations</a>.</p><p>When asked which artist he wants to collaborate with the most, Santana told Reuters: “Well, definitely Taylor Swift, Adele, Beyonce, Metallica, AC/DC, U2. Of course, Eric Clapton.” He then added, “I’d like to enter into the music of the youngsters, you know? Whether it’s rap like Jay-Z. I wanna stay relevant – I don’t wanna be a ghost in a jukebox.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the course of his career, Santana has worked with an array of artists from all genres, including Shakira, Steven Tyler, and Nickelback’s Chad Kroeger. So, it’s no surprising that he’s open to working with people like Swift or Beyonce. For her part, Swift has also worked with many diverse artists over the years and seems open to most collaborations. So who knows? Fans might get a Taylor Swift and Carlos Santana collab in the future!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidq5meoHq1wdGnnKtlopq3pq%2FTnptmmV2YvK24wJtksKGknXq1rdilpqtlo6y2p8CMoqVmnpWWv260xJ1koJ2kYry3sdGsn5qcn6yypXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
