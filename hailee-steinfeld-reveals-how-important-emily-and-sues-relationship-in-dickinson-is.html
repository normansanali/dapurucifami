It was about being seen, and being understood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Emily struggles her whole life to feel understood and seen by those in her very own house," she shared. Dickinson&nbsp;follows the life of the poet against the backdrop of her home in 1850s Amherst, where female writers were frowned upon and not accepted for who they were.</p><p>Comparing Emily's relationship with Sue, Hailee says: "When she’s with Sue, they have this deep, deep love and understanding for each other. It is so beautiful, and gets to be very complicated when Sue becomes her sister-in-law..."</p><p>"The love that they have for each other never, never diminishes." the actor revealed.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Wish Hailee Steinfeld A Happy Birthday Following 'Hawkeye' Series Announcement</a></span></p><h2 id=wiz-khalifa-is-a-huge-fan-of-the-show>Wiz Khalifa Is A Huge Fan Of The Show!</h2><p>Dickinson&nbsp;uses&nbsp;information about the poet that already exists, but takes creative liberty to elaborate&nbsp;most of its&nbsp;eccentric storyline. Emily Dickinson's poetry is a driving force of the series and as Hailee says, the result is "a very wild, exciting period comedy that has a lot to offer."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sharing one of her favourite parts about the series, Hailee says was the scene with Wiz Khalifa!
