In fact, he was even once one of People magazine's "<a href=#>Most Eligible Bachelors</a>," making&nbsp;the coveted list back in 2002. At the time, Page was also starring in the daytime soap "All My Children," and seemingly enjoying his newfound fame... or lack thereof. He told <a href=#>OnMilwaukee</a>&nbsp;in 2003, "I'm not recognized that often," adding, "People are nice and say congratulations, but they don't make me or the people I'm with feel awkward." It appears Page's family also made sure that fame wouldn't get to his head. "They give me a lot of guff all the time," he dished, adding, "They give me some heat about my character's name."</p><p dir=ltr>While Page is no longer a "bachelor" these days, he&nbsp;did attempt to play the field before he met his wife, even making a pact with his two best friends. He revealed to <a href=#>Cosmopolitan</a>, "All three of us were single and we made a solemn oath to stay single the whole summer and have a summer of craziness." That plan however, didn't last long because Page met his now-wife, Cassidy Boesch, soon after.</p><p dir=ltr>All in all, Page has not only had an exciting career since his bachelor days, but an interesting personal life as well. And it seems that the father-of-three will only just continue to&nbsp; charm fans whether it's in-person or on The Hallmark Channel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhoaYF6gI6smKatlaF6sa3GnmSeppOdrq%2FAyKeeZp6RmMG0ecCbpq6sXam1pnnHmqOlpZGnuG6%2F05qpaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
