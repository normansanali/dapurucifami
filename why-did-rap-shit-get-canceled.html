The series starred <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aida Osman</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KaMillion</a> as Shawna and Mia, two former high school best friends who reconnected and decided to form a rap group in Miami, Fla. Actors <a href=#>Jonica Booth</a>, RJ Cyler, and Daniel Augustin also starred in the series.</p><p>Rap Sh!t’s two-season run stunned many of the show’s fans, who tuned in every week to see Mia and Shawna navigate the sometimes intense music business. So, why is Rap Sh!t ending so soon? Here’s everything we know about its cancellation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Max</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Why did Rap Sh!t get canceled? Fans are blaming the show’s network.</h2><p>Rap Sh!t ended its Season 2 finale with a cliffhanger episode on Dec. 21, 2023. While watching the show, no one expected the episode would be the last time we saw Mia, Shawna, Chastity, or any dynamic characters again.</p><p>On Jan. 18, 2024, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> reported that Rap Sh!t had been canceled. However, Max has not given a reason for the show’s cancellation, despite being critically acclaimed and assigned a 100 percent rating on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>. Due to the abrupt ending, the show’s fans believe Max intentionally canceled Rap Sh!t.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Max</span></figure><p>Since HBO Max merged with Discovery in May 2023, forming “Max,” the network has <a href=#>dropped several shows</a> centering on Black voices. Some include <a href=#>Legendary</a>, a show highlighting the Black LGBTQ+ ballroom scene, and The <a href=#>Sweet Life: Los Angeles</a>, which Issa created and executive produced. The cancellations of Black shows is something fans have considered a pattern with Max, as more shows catered to white audiences remain on the network.</p><p>Many online commentators have also mentioned how Max’s marketing of Rap Sh!t, or lack thereof, could’ve contributed to its demise. After being slated to air Season 2 in August 2023, the airing was paused due to the <a href=#>2023 SAG-AFTRA strike</a> and postponed until November.</p><p>However, despite the extra time, several fans shared online that the show didn’t have the visibility it deserved.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>That lil DEI wave in media post 2020 was so short lived.</p><p>Saturdays, Rap Shit, Sweet Life: Los Angeles, The Wonder Years, Queens, All Rise, South Side, Grand Crew, Truth Be Told, and so many more Black shows I loved watching are canceled.</p>— Daric L.

She said she would continue rooting for everyone in the cast in true Issa fashion. She also thanked the series’ executive producer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Syreeta Singleton</a>, for her work on the show.</p><p>“I’m so proud of and grateful for Syreeta, our cast, writers, and crew that made this show possible,” the American Fiction star shared in a statement. “Thanks to Sarah Aubrey and Suzanna Makkos for championing the show, and much love to the fans that tuned in weekly to root for our girls.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Syreeta also released a statement. In her comment, she said she would “forever be grateful to “Issa, our incredible cast, the amazing writers and crew that made this show possible.” Additionally, she thanked Max for the opportunity to allow her and her team to create “something fun, raw, and original and we did it our way.”</p><p>Jonica, who played Mia and Shawna’s often problematic manager, Chastity, also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a> on the show ending on her personal social media.
