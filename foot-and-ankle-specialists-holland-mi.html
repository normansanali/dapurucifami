These include but are not limited to arthritis, bunions, corns and calluses, flat feet, heel pain, hammertoe and claw toe, ingrown toenails, toenail fungus, neuromas and all manner of sports-related foot and ankle injuries. After we have your condition under control, we will work with you on lifestyle changes to make sure your pain stays away for years to come.</p><p>And if you are seeking treatment for your child, our podiatrists are experienced in pediatric podiatry. So they can help your child with issues like toe walking, in-toeing and out-toeing, frequent falls and other abnormal gait issues.</p><p>In addition to consultative medicine, we at Foot and Ankle Specialists value evidence-based medicine and scientific research. This is why many of our podiatrists have contributed to research studies to advance the field.
