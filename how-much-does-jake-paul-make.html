But, the 26-year-old has shifted his focus onto boxing as well as his sportsbook app, Betr, and fight promotion, Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), in which he’s signed several boxers including undisputed featherweight queen Amanda Serrano.</p><p data-characters=275 data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true>He still uploads to his YouTube channel regularly — his video titled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Logan Paul Sparring For Dillon Danis</a>” dropped on Sept. 22 — and he boasts over 20 million subscribers.

They dueled for eight rounds in Diriyah, Saudi Arabia, and although Paul scored a knockdown, it wasn’t enough to earn him the nod from the judges.</p><p data-characters=145 data-current-count=145 data-injectable=false>He lost via split decision, causing Paul’s record to fall to 6-1 while the Love Island UK 5 alum’s undefeated spread improved to 9-0.</p><p data-characters=270 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>Paul bounced back from the loss a few months later.
