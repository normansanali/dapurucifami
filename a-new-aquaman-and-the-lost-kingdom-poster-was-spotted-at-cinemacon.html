Amidst all of that, DC Extended Universe’s final outing, <a href=#><u><strong>Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom</strong></u></a>, carries great anticipations and expectations. After several release date pushes, Jason Momoa’s Aquaman sequel is set for a December 2023 release. James Wan’s effects-heavy, underwater action-adventure is about to enter the press and marketing phase. At the same time, fans anticipate the movie’s first trailer getting a public release very soon.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>Meanwhile, at CinemaCon, a fan spotted a new teaser poster for the movie. The poster did not feature cast members but showed a cracking underwater iceberg.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=455 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>A new poster for ‘AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM’ is revealed at CinemaCon 2023. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/hhv488ofkW</a></p>— Alfie’s Movie Hub (@alfiemoviehub) <a href=#>April 23, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>There isn’t any behind-the-ice threat implied in the poster. Still, it could reference the film’s newfound setting, which James Wan teased early in production a couple of years back.</p><p data-characters=573 data-current-count=759 data-injectable=true>It’s possible that the threat from the titular “Lost Kingdom” comes from beyond the frozen underwater lands. Notably, <a href=#><u>the film’s early working title was </u><u>Necrus</u></a>, referring to another doomed nation hidden in Earth’s oceans. In the comics, the unstable location status of Necrus only allows it to appear through a dimensional hole when an alien satellite triggers the planet’s magnetic fields. Necrus has a strange and antagonistic place in DC Comics. It’s possible that the breaking ice could refer to a similar reveal of the new threat to Aquaman and Atlantis.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>On the other hand, the cracked ice under the ocean could refer to a wider environmental message the movie might entail. In the first film, Orm launches flooding on the surface beaches, throwing off the discarded garbage, shipwrecks, and waste the humans have dumped into the seas and corrupted the underwater life. It’s possible the cracked iceberg could have a similar environmental significance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aquaman-2.jpg><p data-characters=671 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=true>There have been hardly any updates on Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom. Interestingly, Walter Hamada called it a buddy movie during the heavily publicized Depp-Heard trial. He revealed that Momoa’s Arthur and Patrick Wilson’s Orm/Ocean Master would take center stage in the film to face a new rising conflict against the brothers’ home nation. However, with the new management, the film has gone through several changes, including having <a href=#><u>shot a few scenes with Ben Affleck’s Batman</u></a>, which may not be included in the final cut. Since the film is releasing after The Flash and its timeline reset, its <a href=#><u>value in the new DC Universe</u></a> and its <a href=#><u>future are hanging on a thread</u></a>.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=196 data-injectable=false>While Jason Momoa <a href=#><u>has teased a new collaboration</u></a> with James Gunn and Warner Bros. in an enthusiastic social media video, it’s still a mystery if the new collab also brings good news for Aquaman.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom will release on December 20, 2023, ending DC Extended Universe’s ten-year run, which will eventually merge into the new DCU.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomGamlax6or3UmqSapl2Wu6V506GcZqSfqMFut8innp2nnWK9sL%2FTnqlmr5GoerS8zq2rnpxdlsFur8innKaZk6S7cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
