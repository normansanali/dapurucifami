He first ran for president in 2016, arguing he was a candidate who would “tell it like it is.” But that message was drowned out by eventual Republican nominee Donald Trump. Christie dropped out of the 2016 race after a disappointing sixth-place showing in New Hampshire.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/6457ee1ec726bc00196a6481-696x348.webp><p>Christie was born on September 6, 1962, in Newark, New Jersey, United States to Sondra A. a telephone receptionist, and Wilbur James “Bill” Christie, a certified public accountant who graduated from Rutgers Business School.</p><p>His mother was of Italian (Sicilian) ancestry, and his father is of German, Scottish, and Irish descent. Christie’s family moved to Livingston, New Jersey, after the 1967 Newark riots, and Christie lived there until he graduated from Livingston High School in 1980. At Livingston, Christie served as class president, played catcher for the baseball team, and was selected as a New Jersey Representative to the United States Senate Youth Program.</p><p>Christie’s father and mother were Republican and Democratic, respectively. He has credited his Democratic-leaning mother for indirectly making him a Republican by encouraging him to volunteer for the gubernatorial candidate who became his role model, Tom Kean. Christie had become interested in Kean after the politician, then a state legislator, spoke to Christie’s junior high school class.</p><p>Christie graduated from the University of Delaware in 1984 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science; while there, he served as president of the student body. He graduated from Seton Hall University School of Law with a J.D. in 1987. He was admitted to the New Jersey State Bar Association and the Bar of the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, in December 1987. He was awarded honorary doctorate degrees by Rutgers University and Monmouth University in 2010.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-the-net-worth-of-chris-christie><strong>What is the net worth of Chris Christie?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Chris Christie’s net worth is currently unknown at the time of writing this article.
