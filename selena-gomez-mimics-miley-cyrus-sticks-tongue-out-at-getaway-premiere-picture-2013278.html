The 21-year-old "Come & Get It" singer stuck her tongue out to the side while posing on the red carpet.</p><p>Gomez playfully copied fellow former Disney star Cyrus' new favorite tongue move while smiling for photographers. After joking around, the actress blew kisses while showing off her stylish black floral Vera Wang dress, Jimmy Choo heels and Lorraine Schwartz jewelry.</p><p>Cyrus, 20, bared her tongue (and half-naked body) while performing her hit "We Can't Stop" and a duet with <strong><a href=#>Robin Thicke</a> </strong>of "Blurred Lines" on stage at the MTV VMAs on Sunday, Aug. 25. Though the act was highly controversial for its sexually explicit costumes and dance moves, Gomez told Us Weekly she was a fan of it. "It was great!" the Wizards of Waverly Place alum told Us at her premiere Monday. "She worked it!" (Cyrus watched the show from the audience beside BFF <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, who was caught on camera apparently slamming ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a>. She also took home the award for Best Pop Video for "Come & Get It.")</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While Cyrus lets loose on stage, Gomez is focused on ditching her Disney image — in subtler fashion than Cyrus, perhaps — on the big screen. She stars alongside<strong> <a href=#>Ethan Hawke</a></strong> and <strong>Jon Voight</strong> in the <strong>Courtney Solomon</strong>-direction action film Getaway, in theaters Friday, Aug. 30.</p><p>"I wanted to play something that was really different," she told reporters Monday of taking on the role of "The Kid." "I feel like it's too easy to me to take on a role that could be the same role that I've played for years. I want to be something that's completely different and she was such a badass and I was attracted to that. She knew a lot about technology and cars and I thought that was so cool, so I was super stoked to take on this role."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasnZyau6J5xqiknrJdorautcKsZKahnJrGbq%2FYq6ysZaOptqS30marqKaXqrJuu9StZJqsXZyyta3WmrBmqKKauqqx0Z5kqaGTqcKzsYxrZ2prYmyFcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
