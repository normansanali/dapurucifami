The singer has had a huge influence on the <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> industry thanks to her bold antics and popular songs, but she is still asked about her former husband. It's definitely hard not to want all the juicy details of Cyrus and Hemsworth's marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, Miley Cyrus gave an interview and, as expected, talked about Liam Hemsworth. However, the interview quickly went in an unexpected direction when she revealed some information that came as a total shock. Here's whether the singer told a lie.</p><h2 id=did-miley-cyrus-lie-about-marrying-liam-hemsworth>Did Miley Cyrus Lie About Marrying Liam Hemsworth?</h2><p>From a <a href=#>rumored Liam Hemsworth/Jennifer Lawrence affair</a> to what actually went wrong, fans still think about Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus a lot. As far as celebrity love stories go, their romance was absolutely one of the most popular. Ever since they met on the set of the Nicholas Sparks movie The Last Song, the world felt compelled to hear more about this relationship.</p><p>Of course, Miley Cyrus gave many interviews about her famous partner. She never seemed to mind talking about him. She might have realized that people were going to keep asking questions and so she might as well be an open book. At the same time, though, the singer has always been known as a brave and rebellious person who says what she is feeling inside.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/miley-cyrus-denied-cheating-allegations-but-fans-uncovered-clues-hinting-at-a-liam-hemsworth-and-jennifer-lawrence-affair.jpg><p>However, in one interview about a decade ago, the star said something that confused everyone.</p><p>According to Buzzfeed, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus said she was married</a> to Liam Hemsworth in 2013 when she was interviewed by Cosmopolitan. She explained, "I'm happy I don't have to date anyone. I was like, 'I'm so happy I'm married, because you guys are so cruel!'"</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth Did The Opposite With Their Relationship Than What They Promised When They First Got Together</a></span></p><p>At the time, it was surprising to hear the singer make this statement. As far as everyone knew, Hemsworth and Cyrus weren't actually husband and wife. If they had already gotten married, there is no way that their fans wouldn't have known about it. It also seems that the stars themselves would have wanted to share the good news with the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/miley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth-at-the-premiere-for-the-last-song.jpg><p>Fairly quickly, it became clear that Miley Cyrus had definitely told a lie. People published a story in January 2013 and quoted one of Cyrus's representatives who set the record straight: “definitely NOT married.”</p><h2 id=why-did-miley-cyrus-say-in-2013-that-she-was-married-to-liam-hemsworth>Why Did Miley Cyrus Say In 2013 That She Was Married To Liam Hemsworth?</h2><p>It's hard to know why Miley Cyrus lied and said that she was already married to Liam Hemsworth when that wasn't the case at all. Neither Cyrus nor Hemsworth has commented on the lie. People can only make a few educated guesses about what Cyrus was thinking at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/miley-cyrus-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the couple had been together for a few years by the time of Cyrus's Cosmopolitan interview in 2013, it's possible that Cyrus felt that she was already essentially married to Hemsworth. They had shared so much of their lives by then, and they were very serious about each other. She might have been thinking about how close she felt to him and how she knew that they wanted to spend their entire lives together.</p><p>It's also telling that Cyrus made a comment about being glad to be out of the dating scene. Since she was engaged at the time of this interview, she might have felt more married than single.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/liam-hemsworth-and-miley-cyrus.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer has spoken very candidly in a number of publications about everything ranging from her career to her family to her divorce. She might not have even meant to say that she was married. Maybe she reflected on the conversation later and realized that she made a mistake... or maybe she didn't even remember what she said because she talks to the media so often. But, of course, since Cyrus is so famous, her comments made the rounds quickly and people were surprised by what she had said.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Miley Cyrus And Liam Hemsworth Have A Prenup For A Specific Reason?</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus had a long relationship</a> that featured a lot of splitting up and getting back together. According to People, they began seeing each other in 2009, broke up in 2010, and reunited a little while later only to split up once again. While everything seemed to be going well when they shared their engagement news in 2012, they decided that getting married wasn't the best idea after all in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mley-cyrus-and-liam-hemsworth.jpg><p>After a second engagement in 2016, the couple did get married on December 23rd, 2018. People reported that they both posted about it on their Instagram accounts. However, they shared that they were breaking up in 2019. Fans were really sad to learn about their breakup, particularly since they had a rocky road to the altar and had broken up so many times.</p><p>In 2020, Cyrus was on the cover of Rolling Stone and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">talked about her divorce from Hemsworth</a>. According to Entertainment Tonight, she described that she was using substances and very unhappy during the last part of their relationship. She called it "playing house" but knew that it wasn't the right fit. Cyrus said, "I think that’s really what, ultimately, getting married was for me. One last attempt to save myself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Liam Hemsworth Really Cheat On Miley Cyrus? Fans Think So</a></span></p><p>Lying about being married wasn't actually the only lie that Miley Cyrus told. She opened up about a time when she didn't tell her partner the truth.</p><p>According to The Huffington Post, Cyrus said on the Call Her Daddy podcast hosted by Alexandra Cooper that she wasn't honest with the actor when they were first dating and becoming intimate. Instead of saying that she hadn't slept with anyone before, Cyrus said that she had. She was worried that Hemsworth would think she was "a loser." She explained, “I didn’t go all the way with a dude [until] I was 16. But I ended up marrying the guy, so that’s pretty crazy.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdoratsdhmmrKqpah6rbXEZpibp6Wpeq21wKZkoZ2dqMSwvtOhZKaZoqe2orPEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
