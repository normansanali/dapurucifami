Similarly, Chad created a checklist called ‘Covered 85′ in 2005 to evaluate his defensive backs’ ability to cover him. Furthermore, the Bengals’ head coach replaced the list with ‘Did 85.’</p><p>It was primarily intended to antagonize the Bengals’ divisional rivals, and they would use to play against the Baltimore Ravens.

Chad, on the other hand, spoke to the media about how he was treated during the 2007 season. In an interview with ESPN’s Mike & Mike radio show, he stated, “I was labeled selfish and cancer, and it hurt… This year, fingers were pointed at me. If the team and the organization are to progress, I believe you must resolve the issue… It was painful for me. To treat me in that manner and not have my back. Things were said, and no one defended me.’ Similarly, Chad had many disagreements with his teammates, such as Chris Mortensen, after feeling betrayed.</p><p>Furthermore, he legally alters his name to Chad Ochocinco.
