So if you’re making a roast dinner, for example, you can turn the extra roast vegetables into a salad the next day by just throwing some leaves in it, maybe adding some toasted sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds, and then all of a sudden you’ve created another meal.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class="mol-style-bold femail-ccox mol-style-large">PLAN, PLAN, PLAN!&nbsp;</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prue believes that the key to reducing food waste – and shopping bills – is to make a list and stick to it.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘One of the most boring tips is to talk about good household management because nobody wants to do this, and I don’t like doing it myself. But if you don’t, what happens is you go to the supermarket and you’re beguiled by all these things you haven’t thought of, like mangos. You save an enormous amount of time and money if you plan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘If you buy a whole chicken and there are two of you, you need to know what you’re going to do with the rest of it. Last week I had a beautiful free-range organic chicken.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘They’re quite expensive and I don’t like to throw anything away so I cut the whole bird in half and roasted one side, which we had in the traditional manner with sausage meat stuffing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Then I poached the other half very gently, and we had poached chicken with tarragon and cream sauce. I made a soup from the rest of the poached chicken, plus I made stock.

You just need an airtight jar.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Try chopping onion, adding vinegar, salt and hot water, and shaking it. That way you don’t waste a bag of onions. And pickled or fermented foods are probiotic, they modulate your gut microbes, improve sugar regulation and are great for digestion.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>Cook Clever, Waste Less With Prue & Rupy, Monday, 8.30pm, Channel 4.</span></p><p>Source: | This article originally belongs to <a href=#>Dailymail.co.uk</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnoKfCpnnLnqCtoF2Wu6V5w6tkq62grnqiwcmlmGabn6KybsDOZquhnV2nsrSv1J5koqZdnru0vMiroKefXaOyuHnCqKaknaKuerS0zrBkraddqa6kt8ueZJ%2Bnn5l6uK3SrZxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
