When two fighters of this stature go head-to-head, fans expect a pretty intense and entertaining fight. However, this one just had fans reeling uncomfortably at how it ended. But those two weren‚Äôt the only ones who had a bad night at the event. In fact, this was just the first strike of misfortune.</p><p>The bantamweight bout ended with Henry falling to his knees and curling over repeatedly. It was because the fighter had been hit below the belt in a vital spot. The official doctor soon ran to the spot, but their recorded conversations didn‚Äôt satisfy fans, nor did the camera angles. Here are some reactions to the story.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Victor Henry takes one to the groin at UFC 294</h2><p>In the second round of the fight, Basharat attempted to land a kick on Henry‚Äôs thigh. However, the attack may have gone up a bit too much for Henry‚Äôs comfort. He ended up landing a dubious groin strike. Dubious because the camera angles didn‚Äôt give an awful lot of clarity. However, Henry‚Äôs reaction was one filled with agony. The fight was finally ruled a no-contest. Even former champion <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Aljamain Sterling</a> himself had to weigh in his opinion.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cue all the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs acting‚Äù posts now.

However, the official doctor should have been more attentive towards Henry‚Äôs injury if fans were to be believed. Basharat seemed disappointed that the shot landed the fight in so much trouble. In the end, there were no winners, but there was certainly someone with a lot to lose.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>The ringside doctor had a troublesome night</h2><p>At UFC 294, the cage-side physician certainly had to make difficult decisions. Hours after the groin strike, the doctor would also end up dealing with a knee-to-head situation. This was in the Magomed Ankalaev vs.<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9> Johnny Walker</a> fight. Walker sustained an injury on his head that would lead the doctor to the Octagon.</p><p>If <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dana White</a> is to be believed, Walker that he was in the desert when the doctor asked him where he was. That made the doctor call the fight off, and it ended in a <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>no-contest as well</a>. This makes it a total of two no-contests due to injuries at UFC 294. The fans weren‚Äôt the only ones disappointed with these calls.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-ufc-mma-news-will-conor-mcgregors-coach-john-kavanagh-be-in-johnny-walkers-corner-at-ufc294?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/28f7f6e5-2dce-4997-8004-1714333a5346-416x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Will Conor McGregor‚Äôs Coach John Kavanagh Be in Johnny Walker‚Äôs Corner at UFC 294?</p></a><p>Even UFC CEO Dana White had differing takes on the situation. White blamed the Walker ruling on the language barrier and the doctor‚Äôs inexperience.
