She's doing her own thing! The creative, sparkly looks she's serving on her socials are attracting a lot of attention - both positive and negative.</p><h2 id=she-faced-backlash-for-a-bindi-style-look>She Faced Backlash for a Bindi-Style Look</h2><p>On pictures <a class=hoverZoomLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> from her first Shabbat (a feast honoring the Jewish day of rest), Chrissy got criticism for wearing items that have deep cultural significance to some of her followers.</p><p>Fans noticed she had a single diamond-shaped crystal between her eyebrows, which looked like the type of 'bindi' worn by people who follow Hindu and Jain religions. To them, the bindi often represents a '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">third eye'</a> that wards off bad luck. It can also be used to show a woman's marital status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chrissy also wore a white shawl that seemed to be in the style of a Jewish woman's head covering. Orthodox women in the Jewish tradition often wear a 'mitpachat' of this variety to show their modesty, and may sometimes use 'tallit' prayer shawls depending on their community's rules.</p><p>As Chrissy was neither Hindu, Jain, or Jewish as far as the public knew, people expressed concern that she was using these items for fashion purposes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian Slammed For "Cultural Appropriation" Magazine Cover</a></span></p><h2 id=chrissy-says-it-s-not-appropriation>Chrissy Says It's Not Appropriation</h2><p>When the comments about her appearance started to overtake her socials, Chrissy spoke up. She Tweeted that her crystal was not a bindi, because it was part of a look that included crystals around her eyes which were less visible. She also said her head covering would have been worn by her Jewish grandmother, revealing that she does in fact have Jewish roots.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a class=bc-title-link title="Kylie Jenner Slammed For 'Cultural Appropriation' For Trying To 'Look Arabic'" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner Slammed For 'Cultural Appropriation' For Trying To 'Look Arabic'</a></span></p><h2 id=she-admits-the-crystals-are-sometimes-a-mistake>She Admits the Crystals Are Sometimes a Mistake</h2><p>"I<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">f u would like to follow my crystals on the face journey, please like and subscribe to my Instagram or cry about it</span>," Chrissy's Twitter thread continued.
