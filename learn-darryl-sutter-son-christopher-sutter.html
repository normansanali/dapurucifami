If he did, Darryl Sutter‚Äôs son would most likely be blind and deaf and would have to spend his whole life in an institution.</p><p>Darryl Sutter‚Äôs kid had heart surgery when he was less than two weeks old. The doctors had to give him such powerful bursts of oxygen for four to five days that they thought it would make the baby blind and deaf. In addition, Chris also had multiple ear surgeries and bones put in his ears. As for his eyes, one of them is average, but the other‚Äôs eyesight is really bad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Darryl-Sutter-and-his-son.jpg><p>Despite being told that he wouldn‚Äôt survive for long, Christopher is currently leading a happy life with his family. He is now twenty-nine years old and is loved by many, including the members of the Calgary Flames. The hockey players showed support for their coach‚Äôs son at the 2022 World Down Syndrome Day by donning mismatched hockey socks at practice.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Darryl_Sutters_Son_Works_At_Viking_Meats></span>Darryl Sutter‚Äôs Son Works At Viking Meats<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christopher went to the Viking School in Viking, Alberta, Canada.

He works as a cashier and store clerk, runs the till, takes out the garbage, places stickers on vacuumed packed meats, and prices them. Moreover, <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">as per</a> <strong>Yogi Miskew</strong>, whom Darryl Sutter‚Äôs baby boy used to report to, Chris takes great care in what he does.</p><p>Despite all the odds, Christopher Sutter has grown up happily.
