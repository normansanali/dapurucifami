Just like at the start of season 25 in August, we watched Big Brother veterans Frankie Grande, Britney Hayes, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Danielle Reyes</a> sneak into the house and use a “Time Laser.” In the skit, they attempted to close the “Big Brother Multiverse” — something they opened before the houseguests moved into the abode. But, this time they brought to life Big Brother Reindeer Games.</p><p data-characters=15 data-current-count=15 data-injectable=false>So, what is it?</p><p data-characters=280 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>It’s a condensed season of Big Brother featuring nine former houseguests, as well as one <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">contestant from Big Brother 25</a> who has yet to be announced. Chen revealed that the returnees will be “legends” from the series, but they’ll play an entirely new game.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly</a>, the contestants won’t actually be houseguests — they’re not going to move into the Big Brother house. Also, no one will face eviction. They’ll square off in holiday-themed challenges ahead of Christmas, and in every episode, one player will be sent home after losing the “Santa’s Showdown” competition, according to the outlet.</p><p data-characters=410 data-current-count=410 data-injectable=true>It’s set to premiere on Dec. 11 — around a month after Big Brother’s 100-day battle ended, which was the series’ longest season yet. Big Brother Reindeer Games will play out over six episodes spanning under two weeks. All in all, four players will survive to finale night — Dec. 21 — and one player will snag the spin-off’s trophy and the $100,000 prize that comes along with it.</p><p data-characters=151 data-current-count=151 data-injectable=false>Further, because the show will be filmed before its first episode releases, live feeders won’t have the opportunity to eavesdrop on the players.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=564 data-injectable=true>We already know three names attached to Big Brother Reindeer Games. Big Brother 13 alum and season 11 winner Jordan Lloyd will join season 23’s Tiffany Mitchell and Derek Xiao as “Santa’s Elves.” According to Entertainment Weekly, there won’t be a host for the mini-season. Instead, the elves will help navigate the players through the newest addition to the long-running franchise.</p><p data-characters=308 data-current-count=308 data-injectable=false>At the time of this writing, no players have been announced for Big Brother Reindeer Games. Considering Big Brother 22, CBS has been willing to pay it loose with terms like “all-stars” and “legends,” so your guess is as good as ours for who will show up on the mini-season next month.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMCtZKKrXZe2qHnBq6atoJWnerOxyKebnp2iYrSiucSsZJqmlGLEqbHNZpuonaNitrV50q2Yq6xf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
