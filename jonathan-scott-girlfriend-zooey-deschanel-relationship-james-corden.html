Despite that, there is no denying that Corden's late-night talk show has enjoyed a lot of success.</p><p>At the height of The Late Late Show with James Corden's popularity, the Carpool Karaoke segment became a sensation. In fact, the segment was so beloved that it got its own spin-off show, Carpool Karaoke: The Series.</p><p>Back when Carpool Karaoke was just a recurring segment on The Late Late Show with James Corden, major musicians were a staple. Once Carpool Karaoke: The Series premiered, however, the show's producers needed to widen the net.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of the musical parameters being loosened, the Property Brothers Drew and Jonathan Scott starred in an episode of Carpool Karaoke: The Series.
