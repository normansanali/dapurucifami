People compared the cast, who are now in their 50s, to the Golden Girls in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>online memes</a>, while photos of Sarah Jessica Parker rocking her natural gray hair went viral. But SJP isn't standing for the critical comments.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a new interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Vogue</a>, the actress opened up about the onslaught of criticism she's received for her physical appearance since filming And Just Like Thatâ€¦. "There's so much misogynist chatter in response to us that would never. Happen. About. A. Man," Parker, 56, told the outlet, adding: "'Gray hair, gray hair, gray hair. Does she have gray hair?' I'm sitting with Andy Cohen and he has a full head of gray hair, and he's exquisite. Why is it okay for him? I don't know what to tell you people!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "Especially on social media. Everyone has something to say. 'She has too many wrinkles, she doesn't have enough wrinkles.' It almost feels as if people don't want us to be perfectly okay with where we are, as if they almost enjoy us being pained by who we are today, whether we choose to age naturally and not look perfect, or whether you do something if that makes you feel better."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I know what I look like. I have no choice. What am I going to do about it? Stop aging? Disappear?," she concluded.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elsewhere, SJP also discussed the recent loss of Willie Garson, who had played Carrie's BFF Stanford Blatch on SATC and the reboot before passing away from cancer back in September. "All I can say right now is that it's as if a scoop has been taken out of me this week, and I don't expect it to be filled. In time, my body will grow accustomed to this new architecture, but now I feel truly blue," Parker said when asked about the death of her friend. "I think about Willie and the show and how much we laughed. And I guess despite everything, that's the headline: There's so much good in the world, and we were all so lucky to be together, doing something we loved."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9KaqZqgXZ%2BytL%2FInJhmqJGnuKa%2BjqyYq5mYYremv9KimpploJa%2FrLHRZqqlmZ2isqV5wqikpp2eqcBurcGorK1lkZy2r7OMpaaoo6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
