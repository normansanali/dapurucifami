(Previous seasons were filmed in New Orleans, Louisiana, Hawaii, the Dominican Republic, and Puerto Rico.) Prior to filming, each participant in the show must pass lengthy interviews and compatibility testing. The program then employs a unique matchmaking algorithm tool to guarantee that every contestant (at least 20) has a “perfect match.”</p><p>Throughout the course of the season, competitors must determine their true love using a “truth booth” that will either affirm or refute a couple’s compatibility. The group of competitors wins a $1,000,00 prize if they correctly identify every real match in 10 or fewer “match-up ceremonies” or attempts. The prizes are, however, divided in half each time the candidates at these ceremonies are unable to identify any new matches.</p><p>In addition, it should be mentioned that the show had heterosexual pairings in its earlier seasons, switched to a completely bisexual cast in its eighth season, and featured competitors who identified as both genders, allowing any two couples to be their matches.</p><p>The new season of AYTO’s first two episodes premieres on January 18, 2023.
