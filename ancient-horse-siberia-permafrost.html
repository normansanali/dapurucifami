Semyon Grigoryev, the head of the Mammoth Museum in Yakutsk, told the Siberian Times that this discovery is unlike any other.</p><p>This horse was said to have been “completely preserved&nbsp;by permafrost” and was found buried 30 meters underground in the Batagi depression in the Yakutia region of Siberia, according to the <a href=#>Siberian Times</a>.</p><p>The foal was discovered by a team of scientists from North-Eastern Federal and Kindai Universities in Japan while on an expedition to the Verjhoyansky district of Yakutia. The horse was just three months old when it died during the late Palaeolithic period, approximately 40,000-years-ago.</p><p>“This is the first find in the world of a pre-historic horse of such a young age and with such an amazing&nbsp;level of preservation,” Grigoryev said.</p><p>The photos of the perfectly-preserved horse are almost unbelievable. It was found with its tail, mane, and hooves still attached and its dark brown coat seems to be in excellent condition. Also, all of the horse’s internal organs are still inside the animal after tens of thousands of years.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-186729 alt="Siberian Foal Nose Hooves" width=900 height=364 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/siberian-foal-nose-hooves.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-186729 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Michil Yakoklev/North-Eastern Federal University</span><span class=caption-body>Left: nose of the horse, Right: hooves of the horse.</span></p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Science Alert</a>, the baby horse is just 38 inches tall and is genetically distinct from those now living in the region. This horse was an Equus lenesis, also known as the Lena horse, which roamed the area during the late Pleistocene, but is now extinct.</p>Researchers studying the foal.<p>Grigoryev also told the Siberian Times that this find has many other potential benefits for researchers outside of just the discovery of the horse.</p><p>“The extra value of the unique find is that we obtained samples of soil layers where it was preserved, which means we will be able to restore a picture of the foal’s environment,” Grigoryev said.</p><p>The region where this ancient horse was found, known as the Batagai depression, is infamously treacherous and is also known as the “Mouth of Hell,” according to the Siberian Times. The tadpole-shaped crater is one kilometer long and 800 meters wide.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-186730 alt="Batagai Depression" width=720 height=540 data-sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/batagai-depression.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-186730 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>The Siberian Times</span><span class=caption-body>The Batagai depression in Verkhoyansky district of Yakutia.</span></p><p>The locals in the remote region also refer to the huge crater as the “gateway to the underworld” and are heartily superstitious about it. The depression was originally created by the Soviets when they cleared the forest in the area and local scientists now say that climate change is making it larger.</p><p>The amazingly well-preserved horse plucked the “hellish” area is a groundbreaking find for scientists, as they hope it will help them to unlock more secrets of the horse’s environment all those millennia&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Now that you’re done reading about the most well-preserved horse in history, read about <a href=#>the best-preserved woman in history</a>.
