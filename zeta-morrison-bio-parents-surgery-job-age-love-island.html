Turing the heat on, the islanders also were sent to compete in “naughtier games and steamier challenges,” as they decided if they wanted to stay with their current partner or “recouple” with someone new.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>And obviously, those who lacked connections were dumped from the island.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Our star, Zeta joined the show to make a genuine connection. She wanted someone honest, generous, very sweet, kind-hearted, who loves to listen to her, and very very sexy. Infact, she made it clear before entering the villa that she was there to find her husband and she was super serious about it!</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>In the past, Zeta dated “so many different kinds of men,” with one even being a famous person.
