If it was turned around, it meant that everything was operating smoothly and there were no breakdowns scheduled for that day. He racked up a significant number of hours behind the wheel of his combine, picking corn for farmers coming from all directions. It brought him great joy to operate the combine. Nobody other could get a combine set and operate it better than he could, nor was anybody else even close.</p><p>To finally put to rest the question of which hue was superior, a Gleaner will outperform any other option. He took great joy in watching them compete in sports and eventually develop into the mature individuals they are today. His seven grandchildren were the bright spots in an otherwise uneventful existence. The gentler side of “Bumpa” was shown via those interactions, and there was no one else but them that he desired to dote on more than they did.</p><p>Many people admired and looked up to Mark for his willingness to help out whenever it was required of him. Mark would help everyone, regardless of who they were or what was going on, even if it meant giving up the shirt that he didn’t even have for himself. He poured his heart and soul into the operation of the family farm. He was larger than life, and he was the pillar of our community. Mark spent his entire life working in the fields. He cherished and looked up to his brother, Jerry Hodgson, and felt privileged to work the family farm with him. They worked together to manage crops on a number of different farms and to assist other farmers who were in need. Even though farming was his way of life, it was his three children who gave him the drive to keep going. Mark enjoyed working in the field harvesting various crops.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiepaOys63LqJmirKOisq670aKYpWaTpLpwucCromagn5m0tLvNZqaboaSqrrPFjJpkm5mio7K3scudZLChXaeytLXDnqWtZZiWwG6wyJ6baA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
