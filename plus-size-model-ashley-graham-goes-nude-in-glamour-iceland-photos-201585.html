Plus-size champion and <a href=#>Sports Illustrated swimsuit model <strong>Ashley Graham</strong></a> stripped down buck naked alongside her fellow models in a new spread for Glamour Iceland.</p><p>The issue, which was released on Friday, May 8, features ALDA models Graham, <strong>Marquita Pring, Julie Henderson, Inga Eiriksdottir</strong>, and <strong>Danielle Redman</strong> in the nude with the mission of transforming how beauty is perceived in the modeling world. ALDA, which means “wave” in Icelandic, is a coalition of models that looks to promote the ideal that beauty in no way is restricted to shape or size.</p><p>Eiriksdottir spoke in detail about their efforts. “We met secretly for a few months, came up with a business plan, and then met with all the major agencies in New York,” the model explained. “Most of them had never represented models bigger then a U.S. size 6, so we didn’t know how they would react. It was amazing to see the great response we got. After some negotiations, we decided to join IMG, as we felt they could help us have good influence in the business. They love what we stand for. It should’t matter if you are a size 2 or 12. Every model should be represented equally.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Graham, 27, is featured in the issue showing off her modeling chops <a href=#>with her celebrated sass</a>.

At the time, Graham said in a statement: “I know my curves are sexy and I want everyone else to know that theirs are too. There is no reason to hide and every reason to flaunt.”</p><p>Last month, the size-16 beauty was featured in a <a href=#>Swimsuitsforall spoof ad</a> to counter Protein World’s banned ad of a super-skinny model.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGappKWoerS12Z5kpqeUmrlurdKho56xXZy%2ForTApmSgp5Woeq%2FBw55koqZdnLmiuc6uqWahk5q5orrDZqehp6SkwG5%2Bj2pscW1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
