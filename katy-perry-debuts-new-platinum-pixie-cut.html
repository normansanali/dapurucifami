And by the looks of things, she's <i>loving</i> her shorter locks.</p><p>In a <a href=#>video</a>, she asks celebrity hairstylist Chris McMillan what he thinks of her new hair. He replies, "Are you kidding? I've been wanting to do this since the day I met you." Perry admits that she remembers, but, at the time, she just wasn't ready.</p><p>Doesn't look like anything's stopping her now.</p><p>According to <i><a href=#>People</a></i>, Perry shared an Instagram story revealing that she's "so happy" with her "Michelle-Williams-inspired" cut. And who could blame her? She looks gorgeous!</p><p>McMillan, the creative director for dpHUE, explained to People how he achieved the "Teenage Dream" artist's new blonde locks. "Katy had a specific color in mind that she wanted, and I did my best to take her there. The super blonde color works really well with her skin one," he said.</p><p>He further descibed the dying process: "Transitioning to blonde can be rough, so I needed to be very careful with the lifting process. When I have clients go from black to blonde their hair can pull warm a few weeks later, so I make sure they take home the dpHUE Cool Blonde Shampoo and Conditioner to help avoid the unwanted brass and yellow tones. It will keep the color looking vibrant and shiny."</p><p>The new look comes just days after the pop star announced her <a href=#>split from actor Orlando Bloom</a>, whom she dated for a little over a year. The couple's official breakup statement read, "Before rumors or falsifications get out of hand, we can confirm that Orlando and Katy are taking respectful, loving space at this time."</p><p>So maybe there's a chance the two will get back together? If anything, this new pixie cut will surely grab Bloom's attention.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbW5iZoNwt8CtsGaolae%2FunnDnpmurKNiu6bDjKmjmqyZo8Kuec%2Bir6KdXZjCtXs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
