Then the teen said she didn’t deserve it, that Megan Thee Stallion, whose “Savage” was also nominated in the category, really should have gotten the Grammy.</p><p>“Megan, girl,” Eilish said. “I was gonna write a speech about how you deserve this, but then there’s like no way they will choose me.</p><p>“You had a year that I think is untoppable. You are a queen. I want to cry thinking about how much I love you.”</p><p>Beyoncé, now with 28 Grammys, passed country singer Alison Kraus on Sunday to become the biggest Grammy winner of all time for any singer male or female. She now is tied with producer Quincy Jones and three behind conductor Georg Solti.</p><p>“As an artist, I believe it’s my job and all of our jobs to reflect the times,” Beyoncé said after winning best R&B performance for her single “Black Parade.” And it’s been such a difficult time. So I wanted to uplift, encourage, and celebrate all of the beautiful black queens and kings that continue to inspire me and inspired the whole world.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnl6eurrnYrGRraGJmerWt2KWmq2WjrLanwIyapZ1lkprGsLrCnmSmmZuaeqm10q2mq7FdrLWquMRmmaKknJ6ybrHIpaCsoF2Wu6V5x2acZqpdnLK1ecGinmavmaPAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
