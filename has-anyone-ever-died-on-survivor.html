The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CBS</a> staple premiered in 2000, and fans are preparing for its 45th season, which is set to premiere this fall.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>To compete on Survivor, players must leave their loved ones, comforts, and possessions behind. They exist with only the bare necessities — water, rationed rice, and a shelter that they build — while surviving the elements, all in pursuit of $1 million. The game lasted 39 days for most of its run, but now the newer seasons wrap filming after 26.</p><p data-characters=196 data-current-count=547 data-injectable=true>Because of the extreme nature of the television series, a common question asked is whether or not anyone has died on Survivor. The answer’s no; no one has played the game to the bitter end.</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>Production has safeguards in place (especially <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as the show’s evolved</a>) to mitigate and prevent injuries and of course, fatalities.</p><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=true>For example, they have on-site doctors who will diagnose players with ailments if they’re showing signs or symptoms. And if the doctor deems a player’s health is not to standard, they’ll eject them from the game. The structure of Survivor has led to medical emergencies, but only a handful of hundreds of players have been forced to leave the island for treatment.</p><h2 id=h-former-survivor-contestants-have-passed-away-however data-injectable=false>Former Survivor contestants have passed away, however</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=356 data-current-count=656 data-injectable=true>Although no one has died filming Survivor, several former players from the U.S. version have passed away since their time at Tribal Council.
