Howard seemed to be devastated by the news, but also paid tribute to the long friendship the two of them had. What was Ralph's cause of death?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Ralph Cirella's cause of death?</h2><p>Howard announced on Dec. 6, 2023, that Ralph had died, saying that his "heart gave out" during a routine procedure on the morning before. Howard added that Ralph was being treated at the time for a "rare lymphoma" that was "curable and treatable." Howard added that he felt "angry" that his friend had waited so long to take the issue seriously.</p><p>“I just have been so sad and so angry," he explained.</p><p>“He didn’t take care of himself,” the host added.</p><p>Ralph's cause of death seems to have been heart failure that was caused by the lymphoma, which Howard added was made worse by his friend's refusal to address his health or attempt to seek treatment. Even as Howard expressed his anger that his friend had died at just 58 years old, he also spent plenty of time paying tribute to Ralph and to the friendship the two of them shared.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Howard Stern knew Ralph for 40 years.</h2><p>As Howard explained on his show, he and Ralph had a friendship that spanned the majority of both of their lives.</p><p>“He loved me,” Howard said. “Ralph was a trustworthy, dear friend who made me laugh every time I was with him.”</p><p>Howard also said that Ralph frequently accompanied him for his TV appearances, including many of the tapings of America's Got Talent.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by John Stamos (@johnstamos)</a></p></figure><p>Howard even went so far as to credit Ralph with helping him to meet his wife. Howard explained that it was Ralph's urging that Howard attend the party where he would ultimately meet his wife, Beth.</p><p>John Stamos, a frequent guest of Howard's and also a personal friend, was the first to announce that Ralph had died.</p><p>“At the painfully young age of 58, my dear friend, Ralph Cirella, was suddenly taken from us, leaving us all in a state of profound shock,” John wrote. “He was, without a doubt, a one-of-a-kind soul.”</p><p>Howard said that he and Ralph had spoken the night before he died. Howard was hopeful Ralph would survive his cancer treatment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp66tvMdmmqKqlaG5onnCmqysnV2ks26wxJqroQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
