He is best known for hosting the nationally syndicated The Tom Joyner Morning Show, which ran from 1994 to 2019, and reached millions of listeners across the country. He is also the founder of Reach Media Inc., the Tom Joyner Foundation, and BlackAmericaWeb.com, which are platforms for empowering and uplifting the African American community. But how much is Tom Joyner’s net worth, and how did he earn it?</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h3><p>Tom Joyner was born on November 23, 1949, in Tuskegee, Alabama, to Frances and Hercules L. Joyner. He came from an educated family: his grandfather Oscar was one of only 3,000 black physicians in the United States, earning a degree in medicine in 1909. Both of his parents were graduates of historically black colleges, and both Tom and his brother Albert attended Tuskegee Institute, now known as Tuskegee University. Tom Joyner graduated with a degree in sociology. While a student at Tuskegee, Joyner joined the fraternity Omega Psi Phi. At first, his goal was to be a musician, and he joined a band, the Commodores, that included his college friend Lionel Richie, but the band did not make any money and his family encouraged him to seek another way to make a living.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Radio Career</strong></h3><p>Joyner had been involved in college radio and began his broadcasting career in Montgomery, Alabama immediately upon graduation, and worked at a number of radio stations in the South and Midwest, including stations in Dallas, Memphis and St. Louis, before moving to Chicago in early 1978. In Chicago, he first worked at WVON, doing the morning show, but left the station after only three months to work at a competitor, WBMX-FM. By late July 1978, however, he had been hired away by Charles Mootry, general manager of station WJPC (AM) (now WNTD). This station, named for “Johnson Publishing Company”, was owned by John H. Johnson, publisher of Jet and Ebony. Joyner hosted the morning show at WJPC and, while there, gained his first national television exposure as the first host of the syndicated magazine series Ebony/Jet Celebrity Showcase.</p><p>In 1983, Joyner returned to Dallas to become morning host at KKDA-FM. Two years later, he was offered an afternoon show at WGCI-FM in Chicago. Instead of choosing between the two, Joyner chose to take the Chicago position while simultaneously remaining at the Dallas station. For eight years (1985–1993) he commuted daily by plane between the two cities, earning him the nicknames “The Fly Jock” and “The Hardest Working Man in Radio”. He later told Radio Ink magazine that he racked up seven million frequent flyer miles over the course of his employment at both stations; a travel agent had found him a $30,000 fare that would guarantee him a round-trip seat for five years.</p><p>In 1994, Joyner was offered a nationally syndicated show by ABC Radio Networks, which he accepted. The Tom Joyner Morning Show was launched in January 1994, with Joyner as the host and a team of comedians, commentators, and celebrities as co-hosts and guests. The show featured a mix of music, news, entertainment, and humor, with a focus on issues relevant to the African American community. The show became a huge success, reaching more than 100 markets and 8 million listeners, making Joyner one of the most influential and popular radio personalities in the country. The show also spawned several spin-offs, such as The Tom Joyner Sky Show, a TV version of the radio show that aired on weekends, and The Tom Joyner Show, a late-night TV talk show that aired on weekdays.</p><p>In 2003, Joyner left ABC Radio Networks and founded his own company, Reach Media Inc., which took over the production and distribution of The Tom Joyner Morning Show. Reach Media also launched other radio shows, such as The Rickey Smiley Morning Show, The D.L. Hughley Show, and The Willie Moore Jr. Show, as well as online platforms, such as BlackAmericaWeb.com, a news and entertainment website for the African American audience. In 2004, Joyner partnered with Radio One, a media company owned by Cathy Hughes, to expand his reach and influence. In 2019, Joyner retired from his radio show, after 25 years of entertaining and informing his loyal listeners.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Philanthropy and Awards</strong></h3><p>Joyner is not only a radio star, but also a generous philanthropist, who has used his fame and fortune to support various causes and initiatives. In 1998, he founded the Tom Joyner Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides scholarships and financial assistance to students attending historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). Since its inception, the foundation has raised more than $65 million and helped more than 29,000 students. Joyner also hosts an annual cruise, called the Fantastic Voyage, which is a fundraiser for the foundation. The cruise features live entertainment, celebrity guests, and themed parties, and attracts thousands of passengers each year.</p><p>Joyner has also been involved in other charitable and social causes, such as voter registration, health awareness, disaster relief, and education reform. He has partnered with various organizations, such as the American Heart Association, the NAACP, the United Negro College Fund, and the National Urban League, to promote and support their missions. He has also used his radio show as a platform to raise awareness and funds for various issues, such as HIV/AIDS, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and sickle cell disease.</p><p>Joyner has received numerous awards and honors for his achievements and contributions, both in radio and in philanthropy. Some of them include:</p><ul><li>The NAACP Image Award for Best Radio Personality in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, and 2006.</li><li>The NAB Marconi Radio Award for Network/Syndicated Personality of the Year in 1998, 2003, and 2005.</li><li>The NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame induction in 1998.</li><li>The Radio Hall of Fame induction in 2004.</li><li>The DGA Frank Capra Achievement Award in 1999.</li><li>The BET Humanitarian Award in 2004.</li><li>The Mickey Leland Humanitarian Award in 1999.</li><li>The Congressional Black Caucus Chair’s Award in 2002.</li><li>The Thurgood Marshall College Fund Award of Excellence in 2004.</li><li>The Trumpet Award for Community Service in 2004.</li><li>The UNCF President’s Award in 1998.</li><li>The Essence Award in 2000.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Tom Joyner Net Worth</strong></h3><p>Tom Joyner’s net worth is estimated to be between $40 million and $80 million as of 2023.
