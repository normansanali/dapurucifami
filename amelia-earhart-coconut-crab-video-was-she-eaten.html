Yet, in the end, Amelia Earhart sadly perished while attempting.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Several explanations for Amelia Earhart’s demise have surfaced in the years since. According to some, Earhart and Noonan allegedly temporarily survived as castaways on another uninhabited island.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Others think the Japanese may have captured them. And according to at least one theory, Earhart and Noonan were spies who managed to return alive to the United States, where they spent the remainder of their lives using false identities. Her being eaten by crabs is the most intriguing possibility.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The journey that ended with Amelia Earhart’s death had a difficult beginning. According to NASA, she originally intended to travel from east to west.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>On March 17, 1937, she set out for Honolulu, Hawaii, from Oakland, California.
