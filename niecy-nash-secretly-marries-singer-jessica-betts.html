She then also included the hashtag “#LoveWins.”</p><p>The Claws actress, 50, <a href=#>shared the same photo on her account</a>. “Mrs. Carol Denise Betts,” she wrote, with the same hashtag and the diamond ring emoji.

This woman of God, I’m honored and blessed in her presence,” the songstress, who appeared in one episode of Claws that year, wrote at the time. “She’s anointed and appointed. She singin my tune.”</p><p>Nash has been a very vocal supporter of the LGBTQ community through the years. In June, she penned a long Instagram post about limitations at the Supreme Court and later shared a photo of her in a rainbow shirt, writing, “Happy Pride!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Nash was married to <strong>Don Nash</strong> from 1994 to 2007, and the pair share three children, Dominic, Donielle and Dia.
