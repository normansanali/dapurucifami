According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Mitchell’s net worth is as high as $2.5 million, an amount earned through her successful careers. Apart from acting, Beverley released one country music album, entitled “Beverley Mitchell” in 2007, the sales of which also improved her wealth.</p><h3>Beverley Mitchell Net Worth $2.5 Million</h3><p>Beverley is the daughter of David Mitchell, an auto racing promoter, and his wife Sharon who worked as an office manager. However, her parents later divorced, and married other partners, and as a result, Beverley is a step-sister to Giuseppe Tomasino, her father’s child with another wife.</p><p>Beverley went to Chaminade College Preparatory School, from which she matriculated in 1999, and then attended Loyola Marymount University, from which she graduated with a BA majoring in film production.</p><p>Beverley’s career began when she was 10 years old, when she was cast as Jersey in the made-for-television film “Children of the Bride” in 1990, and its sequel “Baby of the Bride”,\ the following year. Then in 1992 she portrayed young <a href=#>Nancy Sinatra</a>, aged between 7 to 9 in the TV series “Sinatra”. Four years later, Beverley was chosen for the role of Lucy Camden in the TV drama series “7th Heaven”, which follows the Camden family. The series launched the career of <a href=#>Jessica Biel</a>, among many other young stars including Beverley, and won her three Young Artist Award in categories Best Performance in a TV Drama Series – Leading Young Actress, Best Performance in a TV Drama Series – Leading Young Actress, and Best Performance in a Drama Series – Young Actress. She appeared in all 243 episodes of the show, which increased her net worth to a large degree, but also increased her popularity.</p><p>While the show lasted she received several other roles, including the lead in the drama “Right on Track” (2003), and as Laura Hunter in Darren Lynn Bousman’s horror “Saw II” in 2005, with <a href=#>Donnie Wahlberg</a> and Franky G next to Beverley. In 2010 she portrayed Mrs. Sherbrook in the comedy “Snowmen”, while in 2011 she was selected for the role of Kaitlin O’Malley in the television drama series “The Secret Life of the American Teenager” until 2013, and featured in 28 episodes of the series, which only further increased her wealth.</p><p>Unfortunately, Beverley just couldn’t land any notable roles in high production films, and as a result she featured in several B-films, such as “The Dog Who Saved Easter” in 2014, then the horror sci-fi “Toxin” (2015), and thriller “Get Out Alive” (2016). Most recently, Beverley was selected for the lead role in the thriller “Taken Too Far” (2017), and in the cast of the TV comedy series “Hollywood Darlings” (2017), next to child stars Christine Lakin, and <a href=#>Jodie Sweetin</a>.</p><p>Regarding her personal life, Beverley has been married to Michael Cameron since 2008; the couple has two children together.</p><p>Beverley went through a tragic experience in the late ‘90s; her friend Angela died in a car accident when she was 15 years old; Beverley dedicated the song “Angela” to her late friend, while also writing about the loss of her friend in her book “Chicken Soup for the Preteen Soul”.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=21.97389380531><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Beverley Mitchell</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 22, 1981</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Arcadia, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5' 2" (1.57 m)</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td>Actress, Producer, Singer</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Education</td><td>Chaminade College Preparatory School, Loyola Marymount University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Michael Cameron</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Children</td><td>Kenzie Cameron, Hutton Michael Cameron</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Sharon Weisz Mitchell, David Mitchell</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Giuseppe Tomasino</td></tr><tr readability=0.32><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.facebook.com/BeverleyAMitchell</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.33333333333333><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/beverleymitchel</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.34615384615385><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/beverleymitchell/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.30434782608696><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/thebeverleymitchell</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.21052631578947><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005238</a></td></tr><tr><td>Albums</td><td>Beverley Mitchell</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Nominations</td><td>Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress - Drama/Action Adventure, Teen Choice Award for Choice TV Actress - Drama/Action Adventure</td></tr><tr readability=22><td>Movies</td><td>Saw II, Right on Track, The Crow: City of Angels, Baby of the Bride, Snowmen, Extreme Movie, Mother of the Bride, Children of the Bride, Mean People Suck, The Dog Who Saved Easter, The Lost Episode, White Dwarf, Toxin, Killing Obsession, Saw II, Right on Track, The Crow: City of Angels, Baby of the ...</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>7th Heaven, 7th Heaven</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=0.94339622641509><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=1.88><td>1</td><td>I like listening to positive things that make you feel good.
