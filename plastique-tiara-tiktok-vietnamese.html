Fellow Season 11 contestant Vanessa Vanjie Mateo (aka <a href=#>Miss Vanjie</a>) said it herself, it's no Instagram filter, she really is stunning. But the drag queen ‚Äî&nbsp;whose legal name is Duc Tran Nguyen ‚Äî&nbsp;isn't just a pretty face, she's a fierce competitor with an eye for design, a mind for marketing, and a lovable personality.</p><p>Though Plastique placed eighth on Season 11, she left a lasting impression, bringing elements of her Vietnamese heritage to our living rooms.</p><p>"It wasn't until after season 11 ‚Äî or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">at the finale of Season 11</a> ‚Äî that I realized that how much my history and my heritage means to me," Plastique ‚Äî who was born in Vietnam ‚Äî exclusively told Distractify over Zoom.

"It completely changed my life. I became, I guess, the RuGirl with the [largest] social media following, I did deals that I thought I could never do, and then I traveled the world," Plastique continued, trying to stay modest.</p><p>Starting on May 17, 2024, Plastique Tiara will compete for the crown once again ‚Äî this time for a good cause ‚Äî as a contestant on RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars Season 9.

She knew little of the magic of the queer community before arriving at the Southern metropolis. She caught the drag bug when she won a talent contest at a Dallas gay bar, as per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glossy</a>.</p><p>"At Station 4 in Dallas!" she clarified to us.</p><p>But Plastique's love of performance stems from her Vietnamese roots.</p><p>"I've always listened to Vietnamese music growing up, and seeing all the theatrical Vietnamese plays, that was my first gateway into performance," she explained. "I performed the songs that I loved in Vietnamese and then slowly but surely, I discovered there are so many talented designers in Vietnam that I wanted to work with."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@plastique_tiara href=#>@plastique_tiara</a><p>Theo em v·ªÅ nh√† ü™≠‚ú® Filmed by @RainDinhquayphim.Official <a title=xuhuong href=#>#xuhuong</a> <a title=tiktokgiaitri href=#>#tiktokgiaitri</a> <a title=plastiquetiara href=#>#plastiquetiara</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ nh·∫°c n·ªÅn - Qu√°ch √Ånh - Qu√°ch √Ånh" href=#>‚ô¨ nh·∫°c n·ªÅn - Qu√°ch √Ånh - Qu√°ch √Ånh</a></figure><p>Additionally, she shared that connecting with Vietnamese <a href=#>LGBTQ+</a> photographers and creative directors became easy after appearing on Season 11. "From there it just blossomed."</p><p>When we asked if there was any one person who roused the birth of the Plastique Tiara persona, she instantly lit up, naming Vietnamese singer Minh Tuy·∫øt.</p><p>"Oh my god, I talk about her so much. She's gonna file a restraining order against me," Plastique joked. "I love her to pieces, I grew up watching her. ... She's like the <a href=#>Mariah Carey</a> of Vietnam."</p><p>We prompted Plastique to touch on what the response has been like since bringing Vietnamese culture and fashion to TikTok, the Drag Race stage, and the People's Choice Awards.</p><p>"After Drag Race [Season 11], for a little bit, during COVID and everything, I kind of lost a sense of purpose," she relayed. "It wasn't until I traveled to Vietnam and I got to experience firsthand the impact of representation on TV. Because once you see someone of your color and they feel the way you feel, and that hasn't been expressed on TV yet, and that person is doing it in real time, it gives you ‚Äî it validates everything that you are as a human. ...
