The atmosphere, as she describes, was electrifying.&nbsp;</p><p id=eE-Zo5_MTLz data-wc=23>“There was wonderful food, a samba band from Brazil, and flowing champagne,” she fondly remembered during her interview with the Daily Mail Sunday.</p><p id=eF_XPS5_Okn data-wc=48>However, the high spirits were soon to be dampened. At this star-studded event, David, then a key figure at Real Madrid and aged 48, was reportedly engaged in a discreet conversation with a Spanish model, secluded at the garden's end. “That hurt,” Rebecca expressed, the pain still palpable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5ce2a12722ef-rebecca-loos.jpg><p id=eUbgyKXGUE2 data-wc=22>The twist in the tale was set into motion by a single phone call. Victoria Beckham, David's wife, reached out to Rebecca.&nbsp;</p><p id=eg3kvrDM7ow data-wc=37>Her distress was evident: David wasn’t answering her calls. "She's upset because she's calling David and he's not answering," Rebecca detailed. Victoria’s request was simple yet filled with underlying tension: "Don't hang up, go and find him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/9e7ebf13e23f-rebecca-loos-insta.jpg><p id=ed8STSuVHe2 data-wc=38>Guided by Victoria’s plea, Rebecca's journey inside Ronaldo's mansion led her to a guarded bedroom door. After informing one of David’s bodyguards that Victoria awaited on the line, she was met with a scene that deepened her anguish.&nbsp;</p><p id=em2iI3GhwdI data-wc=18>With David emerging from the room and the Spanish model still visible, Rebecca could barely contain her emotions.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>David and Victoria Beckham reveal the impact alleged affair</figure><p id=ekFH1AOAieh data-wc=29>&nbsp;“I was fuming and I just looked at him, gave him the phone and said 'Your wife',” she recalled, her voice laden with a mix of anger and sorrow.</p><p id=eU5iZ4og7a6 data-wc=20>As David engaged in what seemed like a hushed conversation with Victoria, Rebecca grappled with the weight of the situation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4a560f090b4a-gettyimages-3219496.jpg><p id=eHKlnXBWoaC data-wc=31>“I was so hurt,” she emphasized. Reflecting on her involvement with David, she stated, “He had me, he had his claws into me, and I was at his beck and call.”</p><p id=elGn7VNDQ8q data-wc=21>It was in 2004 that Rebecca first went public about her alleged affair with David during an explosive Sky News interview.&nbsp;</p><p id=eIgSpXtwd3f data-wc=27>Her words from that time still echo today: “You have to remember, he is a married man... You have to wait for him to come to you.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cec0f0c70634-gettyimages-121051728.jpg><p id=eL4GmLi0ZH6 data-wc=27>David, on the other hand, has consistently denied these allegations. His recent documentary on Netflix, Beckham, delves into the challenges he and Victoria faced amidst the rumors.&nbsp;</p><p id=eUHiE0l6Hh1 data-wc=19>"I don't know how we got through it in all honesty," David admitted, underscoring his deep bond with Victoria.&nbsp;</p><p id=esMb7DCqwhw9 data-wc=30>"Victoria is everything to me. To see her hurt was incredibly difficult... We needed to fight for each other and for our family. What we had was worth fighting for."</p><p id=etzS_weonKO8 data-wc=29>Today, Rebecca, currently a medical assistant residing in Norway with her family, insists her decision to speak out is a stance of self-defense against the portrayal in David’s documentary.</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">David and Victoria's relationship timeline</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/53e7bc0f1be2-gettyimages-498473420.jpg><p id=ezuKAKOXnq><strong>1997&nbsp;</strong>– The couple meet in the Manchester United players' lounge – and it is reportedly love at first sight.</p><p id=ezgtxlLGah4><strong>1998&nbsp;</strong> – David pops the question on 25 January with a three-carat, marquise-cut sparkler from Boodle and Dunthorpe.</p><p id=eq9ywqrYAVR><strong>1999</strong> – &nbsp;The duo tie the knot in July, four months after the arrival of their first child, Brooklyn.</p><p id=e846hJhDvXn><strong>2002</strong> – Second son Romeo is born in London on 1 September.</p><p id=eed-jLvSTUc><strong>2003&nbsp;</strong>– Allegations of an affair between David and his PA, Rebecca Loos, surface</p><p id=eNCGkj_0XZb><strong>2005</strong> – Third son Cruz is born on 20 February.</p><p id=efakRVbMPiB><strong>2011</strong> – First daughter, Harper Seven, is born on 10 July.</p><p id=eD_wyOmD-RA><strong>2017</strong> – Eighteen years after they married, the couple renew their wedding vows in January.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dnyUbWpsZ6Kar6avwppkpaefqHqkuMCipKxlo52ybrLOrqWdZZSWw6qwjJucnKOYlrputc1mmZ6cXay2tbSMpqadnZxirq61w2aroZ2Zp3qissWaoKtn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
