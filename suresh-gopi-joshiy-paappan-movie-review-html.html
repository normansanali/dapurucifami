The movie is a crime investigation thriller revolving around a cold-blooded murderer, whose targets are all men.</p><p>Everyone familiar with Joshiy's style of movie-making would know how he likes to bring emotions alive onscreen, especially while catering to a family audience. In 'Paappan', too this worked, though a little more subtly. Even as the crimes take place and the motives unfold, the focus is more on the emotional journey of some of the main characters.</p><p>Leading the investigation is a smartly-dressed woman police officer Vincy Mathew, played by Neeta Pillai. The investigation gathers steam when her father, Abraham Mathew Mathan (Suresh Gopi) a retired police officer, is brought into the picture.</p><p>Is he the key to the criminal or is he hiding something else? The movie unfolds from there.</p><p>What's different about the script is the pattern of the murders that are committed.</p><p>There is no scope for predictions and the audience is kept on their toes continuously. The suspense continues till the end of the story.</p><p></p><p>The plot is refreshing and has attempted to break away from cliches that exist in the type of crime stories Mollywood has churned out before. Watching a capable woman police officer helm an investigation is quite a delight to watch. She is quick to admonish police officers who do not respect women, which is a reminder of the kind of empowerment women have achieved.</p><p>It feels good to see Suresh Gopi, who has been doing only a handful of movies these day, back in an investigation thriller. However, the man who had once delivered some of his greatest hits as a police officer in Joshiy's movies, is more restrained in this film. Those expecting to see the superstar deliver some power-packed dialogues and action scenes may be disappointed to see the star being relegated to the background. But that is how the story evolves.</p><p>The makers also have to be credited for not being swayed by the superstardom status of the actor and giving him a chance to explore his sentimental side.</p><p>There are several elements in the first of the movie which is quite praise-worthy and story writer RJ Shaan has to be credited for a convincing roadmap to the plot. There is no dull moment in the movie as twist after twist unfolds.</p><p>While the second half is almost as good, it becomes quite evident that the makers seemed to have been a bit clueless on the path to bring down the curtains.</p><p>Though Gokul Suresh does not have many dialogues in the movie, the chemistry between the father and son, is quite nice to watch onscreen. Asha Sharath, as a forensic expert, delivers a flawless performance.</p><p>All the other actors, including Vijayaraghavan, Kaniha and Nyla Usha have also done justice to their roles. The music by Jakes Bejoy complements the movie's moods.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6sMLInmSrnaaesri%2Fjmtna2pfZYRwfphoqq6qlai1brPOqaBmop%2BotarFjKmYmqiglrtuuc6voJ5loprDqrHWZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
