called a "Home Equity Line of Credit Agreement."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>This means he’s allowed to borrow any amount from the bank up to that agreed figure.&nbsp;</p><p>Realtor Billy Rose is a former real estate attorney and celebrity agent, who's co-founder of The Agency, which buys and sells high-end property across the globe.</p><p>Rose explains that such a line of credit isn’t uncommon for the rich and famous, especially if it’s secured at a low-interest rate.</p><p>This is because it can be used to purchase assets or property, which will rise in value at a higher rate than the interest charged.</p><p>It’s unknown if Pitt funded the Carmel purchase with this line of credit.</p><p>He says: "You have an asset, which you use as security for a loan, and during the days of two or one percent [interest], then you have a line of credit where they’re not really charging you anything in interest.</p><p>"For some people, it’s a way of making money - I can take out the money that I’m paying one percent on, then I can use it to buy something, an asset or property."</p><p>Forbes valued Pitt’s net worth at around $300million, but it doesn’t always mean a celebrity has tens of millions in readily available cash, Rose said.&nbsp;</p><p>Rose, who’s not connected to the Pitt deal, added: "Banks take pretty high risks, they’re going to appraise your house and give you a percentage of its value.&nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of wealth is tied up, but it's maybe where they [a famous person] think: 'I want a line, I’m going to take it, if I should ever want it or need it.’"</p><p>Like most celebrities, Pitt has bought his properties through trusts.&nbsp;</p><p>His Los Feliz compound is owned by The Briarcliff Trust and Pett-Dante is the trustee.</p><p>Pitt began building his compound in July 1994 when he purchased a six-bedroom, Craftsman-style house for $1.7million.</p><p>Two years later, he purchased a small house for $380,000 at the back of his land and, in 1998, acquired another neighboring house for $475,000.&nbsp;</p><p>When he was with Jolie, Pitt bought another small property in 2008 for nearly $1.3million.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, he purchased a huge barn structure with a secret cave and its own bar for $1.1 million in 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, Pitt and Jolie installed a skatepark by the side of their main villa, which now wraps around one side.</p><p>There are three pools and Pitt also purchased land across the road for a tennis court. &nbsp;</p><p>Pitt, who has always taken an interest in architecture, wanted to create a free-flowing compound, which was in keeping with the original houses in the area, dating back to 1915.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>His friend, director Andrew Dominik, says: "You go to the homes of most movie stars and they're like really, really nice hotel rooms.
