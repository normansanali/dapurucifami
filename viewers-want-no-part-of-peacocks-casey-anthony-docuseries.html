But that all changed when documentary filmmaker Alexandra Dean got Anthony to talk on camera for a three-part docuseries, titled "Casey Anthony: Where the Truth Lies," streaming on Peacock. (The trailer is on <a href=#>YouTube</a>.) "Here was a woman that was known still, a decade after being acquitted by a jury, as one of the most hated women in America," Dean told <a href=#>BuzzFeed News</a>. "And I thought, 'Well, we never heard from her, so shouldn't we hear her side of the story?'"</p><p>To do that, Dean set up shop in an Airbnb in Orlando for six months, where she interviewed Anthony for hours upon hours. "Casey had never given an in-depth or on-camera interview explaining her actions until now, and as a filmmaker and journalist, my interest was in getting closer to the unbiased truth by hearing all sides of the story â€” from opposing voices to Casey herself," Dean said (via <a href=#>Decider</a>). Dean said that her team had editorial control over the final version of the project and that Anthony had not seen it, nor had she given notes on the film. The result, as far as Dean is concerned, was worth the effort. "What emerges," Dean said, "is a startling psychological portrait of Casey Anthony and a complete narrative of what she says happened to her daughter." But are potential viewers willing to listen?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9kGtoaW9mZMOqsdaeqaxlp5a7tXnNqGSpmaKperCyjKmcmpufmLi0ecKaqp6xXZa7tbTOp7BmnJ%2BYwrSx0aKcrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
