That was six years ago, and now Aviana has turned 11 years old just this year.

She also shared a post on her Instagram account alongside a black and white picture of the duo, <a href=# rel=noopener>captioning</a>,<strong> “Happy 11th Birthday Aviana. You constantly amaze me with your humour, intelligence and spirit. This day is a true celebration. I love you!”</strong></span></p><p><span>The couple rarely has shared the photo of their little girl.

They didn’t start dating until they shared a screen in Pennies, a short film. Their romance bloomed from there after having a date as they came to know that they were made for each other.</span></p><p><span>The couple made their first public appearance at the Oscars in March 2006.

Aviana first met Henry when she was one and a half years. It was then when <a href=# rel=noopener>Aviana touched Henry's</a> booty when he was not looking.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, later in November that year, Adams said her kid’s taste in the opposite have changed as Henry Cavill was no longer her crush.<strong> “She doesn’t (have a crush on him) anymore, she makes it very clear. She’s like, ‘Do you remember that funny time when I thought Henry was cute?’”</strong> Aviana at the time preferred the actress’ Arrival co-star Jeremy Renner, as she <strong>“was much cooler about Jeremy. She’s older now. He has a little girl, so they ended up playing together, so she kinds of thinks of him as a dad,”</strong> Adams told.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6CzZpOkunCvxKWcm6qZqbamv46araKZnpZ6sLjEmmSlnV2crq24zmakqKyYmr9ussCtn56qXZ2yr77YZpqarpmhuQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
