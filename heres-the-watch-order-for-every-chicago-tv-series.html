Since then, the franchise has expanded dramatically.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=383 data-current-count=383 data-injectable=false>As of this writing, there are three running Chicago series with other crossovers into popular TV series, and a failed attempt at a law spinoff. In March of 2023, the franchise reached its 600-episode milestone, so it’s no overstatement to say that there is a lot to watch. Whether you’ve seen one of the Chicago series or all of them, they aren’t the most simple to follow.</p><p data-characters=137 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Fortunately, you can watch them in order if you keep a keen eye for crossovers and have a general guide for when each season takes place.</p><h2 id=h-chicago-series-watch-order data-injectable=false>Chicago series watch order</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/One-Chicago.jpg><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>It may seem a daunting task to binge through the Chicago series, especially in chronological order. Thankfully, the easiest way to watch it is via release order, while being mindful of the crossover episodes between shows.</p><p data-characters=132 data-current-count=132 data-injectable=false>Here is a list of all the Chicago series in release order so you can gauge where all the crossover episodes listed below take place.</p><h3 id=h-chicago-fire data-injectable=false>Chicago Fire</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago Fire</a> was the very first entry into the Chicago franchise. As the name suggests, this series follows the Chicago Fire Department and is the perfect place to kick off your watch of the series. In the show, the firefighters, rescue squad, and paramedics of Chicago Firehouse 51 are sent into situations that often have life and death on the line.</p><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>The show keeps viewers on the edge of their seats during each and every episode. Well-known executive producer, Dick Wolf, makes this another popular show that audiences can’t get enough of. Once you’ve finished season one you can also watch season two alongside the next entry into the franchise.</p><h3 id=h-chicago-p-d data-injectable=false>Chicago P.D.</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chicago P.D.</a> is the second series in the franchise to launch alongside season two of Chicago Fire. It follows Chicago P.D.’s Intelligence Unit, which is led by Sergeant Hank Vought. The cases the department faces are intriguing and include things like drug trafficking, high-profile murders, large felonies, and other organized crime.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>This is one of the most captivating entries in the Chicago franchise and definitely deserves a watch. Be mindful that there are crossovers with Law & Order and Chicago Fire in the first season of Chicago P.D., so make sure you watch those episodes consecutively.</p><h3 id=h-chicago-med data-injectable=false>Chicago Med</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=566 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=346 data-current-count=346 data-injectable=false>The third series to launch was Chicago Med, and it has since become the last multiple-season entry to the franchise thus far. Fans of Grey’s Anatomy might want to check out this show as it has a similar <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">medical drama</a> format. It follows a highly skilled medical team that saves lives while trying to manage their complicated personal lives.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Again, there are plenty of crossovers between this and other Chicago series including in its first season. You’ll want to watch this show season for the season starting alongside season four of Chicago Fire and season three of Chicago P.D.</p><h3 id=h-chicago-justice data-injectable=false>Chicago Justice</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Chicago Justice is the latest Chicago series to debut, but it didn’t last long. The show only ran for a single season which aired alongside season six of Chicago Fire, season five of Chicago PD, and season 2 of Chicago Med.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>The show was about the city’s State’s Attorney’s office. Prosecutors and investigators of the office spend their days navigating politics and pursuing justice. The show can feel a little bit like Chicago P.D., with it’s dealings with the law, which might be why it didn’t last long.</p><h2 id=h-chicago-crossover-episodes-list data-injectable=false>Chicago crossover episodes list</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=613 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=311 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>When it comes to crossovers with Chicago shows, you should watch up to each part in their respective series before you start the first crossover episode.
