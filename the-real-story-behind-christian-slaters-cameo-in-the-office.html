A simple call from John Krasinski was all it took â€” and it didn't hurt that the "A Quiet Place" star was also directing. As part of the episode, Krasinski wanted to record a fake training video that included a celebrity appearance. Having been a long-time friend of Christian Slater's, Krasinski reached out to Slater's representative to check his availability. As fate would allow it, Slater's schedule was open and the role was cast.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>In a 2010 <a href=#>interview with EW</a>, Slater commented further on the general awkwardness of his fake training video. To solidify the cringe factor that already included the introduction: "So, you've just been bought by Sabre, and you probably have a lot of questions. Hi, I'm Christian Slater," the actor tossed in the infamous "thumbs up" at the end of the video, stating: "The thumb's up was a spontaneous moment. I just kind of thought what would be the cheesiest things to do? John wanted it to really look like Kathy Bates [who plays the new boss] paid for this actor to come in and directed him on what to do behind-the-scenes. So I just kept thinking, 'What would Kathy Bates tell me to do?'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCAj2pvbm9fqbWmedGemKVlo6m8s8WMm5yhoZ6ZeqS00aKqraGRo3q0uMCtnKurXZiurrHOZqCnZaSdsm67xZ%2BgnJ1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
