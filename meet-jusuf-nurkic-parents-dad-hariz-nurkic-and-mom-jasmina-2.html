His parents, Hariz and Jasmina, immigrated to the USA from their home country. At that time, he was just a child.</p><p>Nurkic’s dad, Hariz, is a retired police officer from Zivinice City in Bosnia. Moreover, Jusuf is an&nbsp;exact xerox copy&nbsp;of his father, who is 7 feet tall and weighs around 181 kilograms. Also, he was the first person to see his passion for playing basketball.</p><p>After living in the United States for several years, Jusuf’s parents moved back to Svojat, Bosnia And Herzegovina, Bosnia, and Herzegovina. They are currently happily married and enjoying every minute of their friendship.</p><p>Other than that, Jusuf’s younger brother, Kenan, is also pursuing basketball. Moreover, he is attending Mixed High School in Bosne Srebrene 8, Tuzla. Meanwhile, he is guiding his sibling to become a better athlete so far.</p><p>When Jusuf was 14 years old, Hariz met a Bosnian sports agent, Enes Trnovcevic, who took them to Slovenia. He then allows him to play as an amateur basketball player.</p><p>Jusuf corroborated the overall gist of this tale a few years back. We don’t know if his father indeed beat up 14 individuals at the same time. But sometimes in life, all you need is a little luck and your father beating up 14 people simultaneously.</p><p>“He looked at me, and even though I was normal size, he said, ‘That child is going to be in the NBA.'” We just grinned because it was insane.”</p><p>Nurkic had never played basketball before at the time. He didn’t know anything about the game and couldn’t even shoot.</p><p>Nurkic, on the other hand, was captivated after meeting Trnovcevic, so he hired a coach who taught him the fundamentals. As you all know, the rest is history, and Nurkic did end up becoming an NBA player.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=jusuf-nurkic-wife-or-girlfriend-emina-duric></span>Jusuf Nurkic Wife or Girlfriend Emina Duric<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jusuf Nurkic does not have a wife at the moment. But, he is planning to get married to his fiancee, Emina Duric. Likewise, his longtime girlfriend is also from Tuzla, Bosnia.</p><p>Bosnian and Herzegovina National Team center, Jusuf,&nbsp;proposed to his beau&nbsp;on her birthday on Saturday, June 12, 2021. They were enjoying the moment near the seashore in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>At that time, Nurkic surprised his partner when she was facing back. He then got down on his right knee and asked for her commitment. She happily approved his proposal by saying yes. He also gave an expensive diamond ring to her on their engagement day.</p><p>Jusuf then announced his engagement with Emina via Instagram. He wrote, “you are my happiness that covers all my scars. Those of you who are the finest to your spouses are the best among you.” The couple is presently arranging their wedding.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWVmsFuttSsrJ9lnqq%2FrLXCZqeaqpWjwbR5w5qbZqCRp7a7ec2uqaShk2Kur7CMpqamZZqWwK61zZpka2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
