According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Women’s Health</a>, Jayne is paid a reported $600,000 per season of RHOBH, which across six instalments amounts to some $3.6 million.</p><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>For reference, fellow RHOBH castmates like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kyle Richards</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lisa Rinna</a> were reportedly paid $500,000 per season, while <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kandi Burruss</a> of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Real Housewives of Atlanta</a> is Bravo’s highest-paid Housewife with an estimated $2 million per season pay check. It’s important to note that while exceedingly high, Jayne’s net worth is just a fraction of her ex-husband’s, which was said to be around $264 million prior to his legal woes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=true>Since they didn’t sign a prenuptial agreement, that net worth could have been attributed to Jayne, and included ownership in two private planes, $9 million worth in jewellery, $3 million worth in antiques and a dizzying amount in real estate assets. Outside of Girardi — whose legal fees following his 2021 downfall are said to exceed $110 million — Jayne earns some of her net worth through various non-RHOBH ventures.</p><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>Erika Jayne’s namesake music persona was launched in 2007 with the debut single “Stars”. From there, Jayne’s profile continued to grow, with her biggest songs “How Many F***s,” “Pretty Mess,” and “Xxpensive” now boasting millions of streams. Some of her discography has climbed to the number one spot on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart, with royalties also earned from her YouTube views which reach within the millions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Erika Jayne (@theprettymess)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=293 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Along the music line, Jayne was cast as Roxie Hart in the Broadway musical Chicago in 2020. While a specific salary remains unclear, it has been reported that Jayne was paid handsomely for the role, despite the production being shut down weeks out from its finale due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Elsewhere, Jayne released a commercially successful book titled Pretty Mess in 2018, which became a New York Times best-seller and no-doubt earned her a sizable paycheck. In terms of brand deals, Jayne has partnered with companies like ShoeDazzle and the Savage x Fenty lingerie line, with her sponsored social media posts also contributing to her net worth.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=536 data-injectable=false>More recently, Jayne has embarked on a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Las Vegas concert residency</a> titled ‘Bet It All on Blonde’, which wraps up in December and costs anywhere between $14 to $69 per ticket.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZaKarq15x6isrJ2nnsOmv4yeqaKjkWK3osXNnqpmppWperi70a2faA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlinkVlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
